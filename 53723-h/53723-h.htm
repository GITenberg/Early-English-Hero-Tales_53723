<p>The master-stories of English literature told for young
readers. The author, who has been professor of English Literature
at Mt. Holyoke and the author of several successful
books for both younger and older readers, has been occupied
for a long time in making a selection of the best stories from the
greatest English writers beginning with "Beowulf" and the dawn
of English letters.</p>

<p>The present volume offers masterpieces chosen from the
earliest English literature from the seventh to the fourteenth
century, stories which are not readily accessible.</p>

<p>The second volume will offer hero tales of the Middle English
period, from Chaucer and others.</p>

<p>In later volumes selections will be made from the masters
of modern English literature.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>Supposing you were asked to enter a Great
Palace? And within that palace, you were
told, were more than a thousand golden doors?
And those doors opened into rooms and upon gardens
and balconies, all of which were the most
beautiful of palace rooms and gardens? And
some were more beautiful than anything the world
had ever known before? Do you think you would
go through the gate to that palace?</p>

<p>And if you were told that in the palace were
lamps so bright that they lighted not only the
palace, but cast a glow over the whole world?
And that these lamps hung from chains the ends
of which you could not see, just as Pryderi was
not able to see the ends of the hanging golden
chains in the palace which he entered? And
once within the Great Palace you were not only
better for being there, but also happier and
stronger and more beautiful, and never any more
could you be lonely? It sounds like an Aladdin's
lamp, does it not, which, once seen and touched,
could bring so much beauty and power into our
lives! Indeed, it is Aladdin's lamp&mdash;the lamp
of men's minds and souls. And the Great Palace
is the Palace of English Literature.</p>

<p>Over those doors are many names written&mdash;names
never to be forgotten while the English
tongue is spoken. And in that palace there is
fairyland; there are giants and monsters; there
are warrior heroes like Beowulf, and saintly
heroes like Cuthbert; there are noble boys like
Alfred; there are poets, princes, lovely ladies,
little children, spirited horses, faithful dogs;
there are heard the sound of singing, the playing
of the harp, the beat of feet dancing, cries of gladness,
cries of sorrow, the rolling of the organ, the
fluting of birds, the laughter of water, and the
whisper of every wind that has blown upon the
fields of the world; there are seen flowers of
every marvelous and starlike shape, of every
rainbow hue, and jewels as shining as the lamps
hanging in the Great Palace, and fruits rare and
strange filling the Great Palace with sweet fragrance
and color; there are rooms unlike any rooms
we have ever seen before; and the years are there&mdash;nearly
two thousand&mdash;numbered and made beautiful;
there, too, are Wisdom and Kindness and
Courage and Faith and Modesty and Love and
Self-Control, coming and going hither and yon
through the wide hallways or on service bent up
and down the narrow corridors.</p>

<p>It is a Palace of Enchantment, is it not? Yes,
it is a Palace of Enchantment, and I can think of
no greater happiness, no stronger assurance that
we shall learn how to be our best selves and to
rule ourselves, no greater inspiration to be wise
and kind while we are boys and girls, and when
we grow up no fuller promise of a good time and
many kinds of happiness and pleasure, than just
to take the gate into that palace, listen to its
songs and poems and stories, taste of its fruits,
hold some of its flowers in our hands, grow warm
in its sunshine, dream in its moonlight, and watch
the fairies dance with the feet that dance there,
play with its jewels, listen to the whisper of the
winds that blow around the world, lay our hands
in the brave hands of Love and Courage, Wisdom
and Kindness, who dwell there; knock on those
golden doors where we would go in and be alone;
and come out again, knowing that we have won
the great enchantment, which is the companionship
of beautiful and imperishable story and
poem, song and play.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful Palace of English Literature
in which we shall see many marvels: the first
English hero, Beowulf, and the monster Grendel;
all the fortunes and misfortunes of the little,
radiant-browed Welsh boy called Taliesin, the
battle of the friends Cuchulain and Ferdiad, who
were betrayed by the false Irish Queen Maeve;
how song came to our first great English poet,
Cædmon, in the cow-stall at the Monastery of
Whitby (670); of the courage of a shepherd lad
who had became a saint, and of even the seals
who loved St. Cuthbert (seventh century); of
the young Prince Alfred who won a book as a
prize (849-900); of Havelok, the son of the King
of Denmark, who lived with Fisherman Grim at
Grimsby; of a man who was under enchantment
as a wolf part of the week and whom Marie
de France called a Werewolf; of all the marvels
that Geoffrey of Monmouth (1147) saw from his
window; and especially of the wonders which
King Arthur's magician, Merlin, worked; and of
the red and white dragons that came out of a
drained pond; and of a famous kitchen-boy who
became a great knight, and about whom Sir
Thomas Malory tells one exciting adventure in
the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i> (1469).</p>

<p>What boys and girls will enter the gate with
me? Shall we go into the Great Palace to-day?
And on what golden door shall we rap first that
we may be admitted?</p>

<small>THE FIRST ENGLISH HERO</small></h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 8%" >

</div>


<p>The first golden door we open in
the Great Palace shows us a hero, and
that is as it should be, for the English
have always been brave. Yet probably
the poem about this first English hero
is not the first poem. The first is a
poem by the name of the "Far Traveller."
"Many men and rulers have
I known," says this traveler; "through
many strange lands I have fared throughout the
spacious earth." This poem may not be of great
value, but it is a wonderful experience to open
this door and see back, back, back, thousands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>years to the very cradle in which English literature
was born. This first Englishman was a wanderer,
as all Englishmen, despite their love of home,
have been, or else they would not hold so many
great dominions as they do to-day. Then, too,
there was "Deor's Lament," with its sad refrain,</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0"><i>Thas ofer eode, thisses swa maeg</i></span>
    <span class="i0">(That was overcome, so may this be)</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and its grave thought that "The All-wise Lord of
the world worketh many changes." One more
poem, or, better, fragment, is spoken of in <i>Beowulf</i>.
"The Fight at Finnesburg" is full of the
savagery and fierceness of warfare; it is even more
wild and barbarous than "Beowulf."</p>

<p>Now let us open the door over which is written
<i>Beowulf</i>. It is one of the oldest and rudest of
the golden doors in the Great Palace of English
Poetry, but also one of the most precious. The
pictures we are to see are beautiful sometimes.
More often they are cruel and pitiless.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sun was shining, the wind was blowing, the
air was as sweet-smelling as if it rose from fields
of lilies, and it was the very springtime of the
world some two thousand years ago.</p>

<p>By song little Widsith has seen his master bind
all men and all beasts. Not only the fish and
worms forgot their tasks, but even the cattle
stopped grazing, and, where they passed, men and
children paused to listen. They were on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
way to the Great Hall to have a sight of the hero,
Beowulf.</p>

<p>Behind them lay the sea and the coast-guard
pacing up and down. Before them, landward,
rose a long, high-roofed hall. It had gable ends
from which towered up huge stag-horns. And the
roof shone only less brightly than the sun, for it
was covered with metal.</p>

<p>About the Great Hall toward which little Widsith
and the master were traveling was the village
made up of tiny houses, each in its own patch of
tilled ground and apple-trees, and with fields in
which sheep and oxen and horses were pastured.
Narrow paths wound in and out everywhere.
In front of the Hall was a broad meadow across
which the king and queen and their lords and
ladies were used to walk.</p>

<p>There was much going on that day in Heorot.
Flocks of children were playing about the pretty
paths. Mothers and aunts and older sisters sat
spinning in the open doorways. Beyond the wide
meadow young men and boys were leading or
riding spirited horses up and down to exercise
them.</p>

<p>And all&mdash;men, women, and children alike&mdash;were
talking about Beowulf, who had come to kill the
monster Grendel and free the people of Heorot.</p>

<p>Beowulf had not much more than entered the
Hall when the scôp, or singer, as little Widsith's
master was called, entered too. In those days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
singers were welcome everywhere. They saw
Beowulf stride mightily across the many-colored
floor of Heorot and go up to the old King. And
they heard his voice, which sounded like the
rumble of a heavy sea on their rock-bound coast.</p>

<p>"Hrothgar!" he said to the old King, "across
the sea's way have I come to help thee."</p>

<p>"Of thee, Beowulf, have we need," replied the
old King in tears, "for Heorot has suffered much
from the monster."</p>

<p>"I will deliver thee, Hrothgar," said Beowulf,
in his great voice; "thee and all who dwell in
Heorot."</p>

<p>"Steep and stony are the sea cliffs, joyless our
woods and wolf-haunted, robbed is our Heorot,
for to Grendel can no man do aught. He breaks
the bones of my people. And those of my people
he cannot eat in Heorot he drags away on to
the moor and devours alive."</p>

<p>And the old, bald-headed King, seated on his
high seat in the Hall between his pretty daughter
and his tired Queen, sighed as he thought of the
approaching night. Yet, now that Beowulf had
come, he hoped.</p>

<p>Together they gathered about the banquet.
Beowulf sat among the sons of the old King.
The walls inside were as bright as the roof, and
gold-gilded, and the great fires from which smoke
poured out through openings in the roof were
cheerful and warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Then little Widsith's master was called up,
and Widsith placed the harp for him. Clear rose
the song from the scôp's lips, and all the company
was still. For a while they forgot the monster
which, even now with the falling dusk, was striding
up from the sea, perhaps by the same path
Beowulf and Widsith and the scôp had come.
Already it had grown dark under heaven and
darker in the Hall, and the place was filled with
shadowy shapes.</p>

<p>And now came Grendel stalking from the cloudy
cliffs toward the Gold Hall. It would have been
hard for four men to have carried his huge head,
so big it was. The nails of his hands were like
iron, and large as the monstrous claws of a wild
beast. And, since there was a spell upon him, no
sword or spear could harm him.</p>

<p>While others slept&mdash;even frightened little Widsith,
who had thought he could never sleep&mdash;Beowulf
lay awake, ready with his naked hands
to fight Grendel.</p>

<p>Suddenly the monster smote the door of Heorot,
and it cracked asunder. In he strode, flame
in his eyes, and before Beowulf could spring upon
him or any one awake, he snatched a sleeping
warrior and tore him to pieces.</p>

<p>Beowulf, who had the strength of thirty men
in his body, gripped him, and the dreadful battle
and noise began. The benches were overturned,
the walls cracked, the fires were scattered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
dust rose in clouds from the many-colored floor
as Beowulf wrestled with Grendel.</p>

<p>The scôp had seized his harp and was playing
a great battle song, but music has no power
over such evil as Grendel's. Beowulf himself,
who was struggling to break the bone-house
of the monster in the din of the mighty battle,
did not hear it, either. And the song was lost
in the noise and dust which rose together in
Heorot.</p>

<p>Even the warriors, who struck Grendel with
their swords, could not help Beowulf, for neither
sword nor spear could injure the monster. Only
the might of the hero, himself, could do aught.</p>

<p>At last, with the strength of thirty men, Beowulf
gripped the monster. And Grendel, with
rent sinews and bleeding body, fled away to the
ocean cave where he had lived. And there in the
cave, with the sea blood-stained and boiling above
him, he died, outlawed for evil.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the second part of this poem Beowulf was
living as king in his own land, and ruling like the
great and brave king he was. But a huge old
dragon who was guarding a treasure was robbed.
So angry was the dragon that he left his heap of
treasure and came down upon the land of King
Beowulf, burning it and terrifying the people.
Then Beowulf, who had become an old man, felt
that he must fight to save his people. He went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
out and slew the dragon, but was himself scorched
to death by the fiery breath of the dragon.</p>

<p>"Beowulf" is the epic of our old English period.
An epic is an heroic poem. In "Beowulf" the
story of Beowulf's great deeds&mdash;such as his struggle
with Grendel and Grendel's mother&mdash;and of
his death is told. Probably it was sung before
the fifth century, when the English conquered
Britain, for England itself is not mentioned in this
wonderful poem. Indeed, the country described
is that of the Goths of Sweden and of the Danes.
Your geography will show you where Sweden
and Denmark are. When the English forefathers
came to England they brought this poem with
them, perhaps in the form of short poems which
were woven together by a Christian Northumbrian
poet in the eighth century or thereabouts.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how this wild moorland,
over which Grendel stalked and over which
the dreadful dragon dragged his length, became,
with the cultivation of the land and advancing
civilization, the gentle and beautiful dwelling of
the fairies. The fairies will not live where it is
too wild.</p>

<p>Much is to be learned from this epic of the customs
and the manners of the men who came to
Britain and conquered it. We can see these
people as they lived in their sea-circled settlements,
the ships they used to sail upon the sea,
how their villages looked, and the boys and girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and grown-ups in them; the rocks and hills and
ocean waves that made up their out-of-door world;
the good times they had; their games and amusements.
We come to know the respect that was
given to their women; we see the bravery of the
men in facing death, and we hear the songs they
sang.</p>

<p>"Beowulf" is a great poem&mdash;English literature
knows no poem that is more sacred to it&mdash;but it
is a sorrowful poem, too. These people believed
in Fate, for Christ had not yet been brought to
them with His message of love and peace and joy.
English poetry to-day is much more joyous&mdash;because
it is Christian poetry&mdash;than it ever could
have been if England had remained a heathen
land. Yet English poetry still has much in common
with "Beowulf," in love of the sea and worship
of nature, and a strange sense of Fate.</p>

<p>But we must close this door over which is
written <i>Beowulf</i>, for the Great Palace is full of
many doors and many stories, and we have only
just begun our journey from golden door to golden
door.</p>

<small>WELSH MAGIC</small></h2>


<p>On the other side of most of the golden doors
through which we shall pass, our own tongue,
English, is spoken. Yet in this wonderful palace,
full of beautiful thoughts and beautiful expression,
there are two doors which when thrown
open we may enter, but where our English would
not be understood. They both admit us to the
poems and prose of families of the same race&mdash;a
race called Celtic. Over one door of this family,
however, is written <i>Cymric</i>, and all that is Cymric
is written and spoken in Welsh. On the other
door is <i>Gaelic</i>, and all that is Gaelic is Irish and
Scotch. And the Great Palace of English Literature,
with its innumerable golden doors, would
not be at all the same palace if it were not for
these two little doors, for out of them has come
much that is best in poetry and prose.</p>

<p>The Welsh were already in Britain when the so-called
"English" landed on the island, and these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>English, after one hundred and fifty years, succeeded
in driving the Welsh, or Cymru, back to
the mountains and coast on the west of the island.
There they lived among the mountains,
holding fast to their customs and to their songs
and poetry. And by and by, when it was time
for this miracle to happen, the little golden door
over which was written <i>Cymric</i>, or <i>Welsh</i>, opened,
and out of it there passed one of the most beautiful
story-cycles the world has ever known, the
tales about King Arthur. But of this great story
we shall hear later.</p>

<p>This little golden door may be the oldest in
all the palace, for long before the Arthur story
was born there were other tales which the Cymru
loved. There is a word "prehistoric" which accurately
describes some of these stories known as
<i>Mabinogion</i>, which means, literally, Tales for the
Children, or Little Ones. This famous book was
translated from Welsh into English by Lady
Charlotte Guest in 1838. Among the oldest of
these tales is "Taliesin," which has behind it a
prehistoric singer, a mythic singer.</p>

<p>And now let us open that door over which is
written <i>Cymric</i>, or <i>Welsh</i>, and look in.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Long ago, at the beginning of King Arthur's time
and the famous Round Table, there lived a man
whose name was Tegid Voel. His wife was called
Caridwen. And there was born to them a son,
Avagddu, who was the ugliest boy in all the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>When Caridwen looked at Avagddu, and knew
beyond any doubt that he was the ugliest boy in
all the world, she was much troubled. Therefore
she decided to boil a caldron of Inspiration and
Science for her son, so that Avagddu might hold
an honorable position because of his knowledge.</p>

<p>Caridwen filled the caldron and began to boil
it, and all knew that it must not cease boiling for
one year and a day&mdash;that is, until three drops of
Inspiration had been distilled from it. Gwion
Bach she put to stirring the caldron, and Morda,
a blind man, was to keep the caldron boiling day
and night for the whole year. And every day
Caridwen gathered charm-bearing herbs and put
them in to boil.</p>

<p>And it was one day toward the close of the year
that three drops of the liquid in the caldron flew
out upon the finger of Gwion Bach, who was stirring
the liquid. It burnt him, and he put his
finger in his mouth. Because of the magic of
those drops he knew all that was going to happen.
And he was afraid of the wiles of Caridwen, and
in fear he ran away.</p>

<p>All the liquor in the caldron, except the three
charm-bearing drops that had fallen upon the
finger of Gwion Bach, was poisonous, and therefore
the caldron burst. When Caridwen saw
the work of her whole year lost, she was angry
and seized a stick of wood. With the stick she
struck Morda on the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou hast disfigured me wrongfully," he said,
"for I am innocent."</p>

<p>"Thou speakest truth," she replied; "it was
Gwion Bach robbed me."</p>

<p>And Caridwen went forth after Gwion Bach,
running.</p>

<p>When little Gwion saw her coming, because of
the magic drops that had touched his finger, he
was able to change himself into a hare. But
thereupon Caridwen changed herself into a greyhound,
and there was a race fleeter almost than
the wind. Caridwen was nearly upon him when
little Gwion turned toward the river and became
a fish. Then Caridwen changed herself from a
greyhound into an otter, and chased little Gwion
under the water. So close was the chase that he
had to turn himself into a bird of the air. Whereupon
Caridwen became a hawk and followed him
and gave him no rest in the sky. She was just
swooping down upon him, and little Gwion thought
that the hour of his death had come, when he
saw a heap of winnowed wheat on the floor of the
barn, and he dropped into the wheat and turned
himself into one of the grains. And then what
do you think happened? Caridwen changed herself
into a high-crested black hen, hopped into the
wheat, scratching it with her feet, found poor little
Gwion Bach, who had once been a boy, then in
turn became a rabbit, a fish, a bird of the air,
and was now a grain of wheat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Caridwen swallowed him! But so powerful
was the magic of those three drops of Inspiration
which had touched his finger, that little Gwion
appeared in the world again, entering it as a
beautiful child. And even Caridwen, because of
his beauty, could not bear to kill him, so she
wrapped him in a leathern bag and cast him into
the sea. That was on the twenty-ninth day of
April.</p>

<p>Where Caridwen threw little Gwion into the
sea was near the fishing-weir of Gwyddno by
Aberstwyth. And even as Caridwen had the
ugliest son in all the world, so had Gwyddno the
most unlucky, and his name was Elphin. This
year Gwyddno had told Elphin that he might
have the drawing of the weir on May Eve. Usually
the fish they drew from the weir were worth
about one hundred pounds in good English silver.
His father thought that if luck were ever going
to come to Elphin, it would come with the drawing
of the weir on May Eve.</p>

<p>But on the next day, when Elphin went to
look, there was nothing in the weir except a
leathern bag hanging on a pole.</p>

<p>One of the men by the weir said to Elphin:
"Now hast thou destroyed the virtue of the weir.
There is nothing in it but this worthless bag."</p>

<p>"How now," said Elphin, "there may be in
this bag the value of an hundred pounds."</p>

<p>They took the bag down from the pole, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Elphin opened it, and as he opened it he saw the
forehead of a beautiful boy.</p>

<p>"Behold a radiant brow!" cried Elphin. "Taliesin
shall he be called."</p>

<p>Although Elphin lamented his bad luck at the
weir, yet he carried the child home gently on
his ambling horse. Suddenly the little boy began
to sing a song in which he told Elphin that
the day would come when he would be of more
service to him than the value of three hundred
salmon.</p>

<p>And this song of comfort was the first poem
the little, radiant-browed Taliesin ever sang. But
when Gwyddno, the father of Elphin, asked him
what he was, he sang again and told the story of
how he had fled in many shapes from Caridwen;
as a frog, as a crow, as a chain, as a rose entangled
in a thicket, as a wolf cub, as a thrush,
as a fox, as a martin, as a squirrel, as a stag's
antler, as iron in glowing fire, as a spear-head
from the hand of one who fights, as a fierce
bull, as a bristly boar, and in many other forms,
only to be gobbled up in the end as a grain of
wheat by a black hen.</p>

<p>"What is this?" said Gwyddno to his son
Elphin.</p>

<p>"It is a bard&mdash;a poet," the son answered.</p>

<p>"Alas! what will he profit thee?"</p>

<p>"I shall profit Elphin more than the weir has
ever profited thee," answered Taliesin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>And the little, radiant-browed boy began to
sing another song:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">"Wherefore should a stone be hard;</span>
    <span class="i1">Why should a thorn be sharp-pointed;</span>
    <span class="i1">Who is hard like flint;</span>
    <span class="i1">Who is salt like brine;</span>
    <span class="i1">Who is sweet like honey;</span>
    <span class="i1">Who rides in the gale?"</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then bade he Elphin wager the King that he
had a horse better and swifter than any of the
King's horses. Thus Elphin did, and the King
set the day and the time for the race at the place
called the Marsh of Rhiannedd. And thither
every one followed the King, who took with him
four-and-twenty of his swiftest horses.</p>

<p>The course was marked and the horses were
placed for running. Then in came Taliesin with
four-and-twenty twigs of holly, which he had
burned black, and he put them in the belt of the
youth who was to ride Elphin's horse. He told
this youth to let all the King's horses get ahead
of him; but as he overtook one horse after the
other he was to take one of the burnt twigs of
holly and strike the horse over the crupper, then
let the twig fall. This the youth who rode Elphin's
horse was to do to each of the King's
horses as he overtook it, and he was to watch
where his own horse should stumble, and throw
down his cap on that spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon the youth who rode Elphin's horse,
and all the King's riders, pricked forth upon their
steeds, their horses with bridles of linked gold
on their heads, and gold saddles upon their backs.
And the racing horses with their shell-formed
hoofs cast up sods, so swiftly did they run, like
swallows in the air. Blades of grass bent not beneath
the fleet, light hoofs of the coursers.</p>

<p>Elphin's horse won the race. Taliesin brought
Elphin, when the race was over, to the place where
the horse had stumbled and where the youth had
thrown down his cap as he had been told. Elphin
did as Taliesin bade him and put workmen to dig
a hole in this spot. And when they had dug the
ground deep enough, there was found a large
caldron full of gold.</p>

<p>Then said Taliesin: "Elphin, behold! See what
I give thee for having taken me out of the weir
and the leathern bag! Is this not worth more to
thee than three hundred salmon?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the <i>Mabinogion</i> stories, first collected and
set down some time in the twelfth century, we
live in a world of enchantment and fairies. Those
tales are full of gold&mdash;the gold of a wondrous
imagination. It would be nice if we could keep
this door, over which is written <i>Welsh</i>, open long
enough so that I might tell you the story of
Pryderi, too, and how Pryderi found a castle
where no castle had ever been, how he entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
it and saw "In the center of the castle floor ...
a fountain with marble-work around it, and on
the margin of the fountain a golden bowl on a
marble slab, and chains hanging from the air,
to which he saw no end." What happened to
him when he seized this cup, how the castle faded
away, how the heroes of the story were changed
to mice&mdash;for none of this can we hold open the
golden door any longer. The ends of the golden
chains of many a story are not to be seen by us.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">III</a><br /><br />

<small>THE BATTLE AT THE FORD</small></h2>


<p>It is interesting to think, is it not, that if it
had not been for those two little Celtic doors
of gold over one of which was written <i>Cymric</i>,
or <i>Welsh</i>, and over the other, <i>Gaelic</i>, or <i>Irish</i>,
our Great Palace of English Literature could not
have been the same palace, nor half so beautiful.
It is not only that there would not have been so
many wonderful golden doors leading into story-land,
but the stories themselves would not have
been told in the same way. The Scotch, too, who
belong to the Celtic family, are almost as great
story-tellers as the Welsh and Irish.</p>

<p>When the Roman Tacitus wrote about the
Welsh and Irish he said, "Their language differs
little." And even their buildings, Cæsar said,
were "almost similar." What was true of their
speech and their buildings was more true of the
gifts they have left in the Great Palace. They
have the same delightful way of telling a story;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
what they have to say naturally falls into conversations,
and they are quick as a wink in the
wit and fun and beauty and sadness of what
they do say.</p>

<p>This little golden door and the wonderful room
beyond it were, perhaps, longer in being built
than the Welsh. These stories and poems of the
Irish were composed at the time of Cæsar and the
Christian era. The epic cycle of Conchubar and
Cuchulain is the first group of tales in Irish literature.
They are made up of prose with occasional
verses here and there. The Irish are very clever
at invention, and these stories are among the
most wonderful ever written or sung. Among the
best of these stories is one we shall open a door
to listen to&mdash;the story of Ferdiad and Cuchulain
in "The Battle at the Ford."</p>

<p>The dialogue in "The Battle at the Ford" shows
us plainly how great the Irish dramatic gift has
always been. They were born makers of plays.
Just see how the Irish genius makes Ferdiad and
Cuchulain talk, and how lifelike they are! The
story is there, not much changed from what it
was two thousand years ago, and shows all the
Irish sense of form. By sense of form is meant
simply the story's way of expressing itself. You
see, a story or poem is like a human being. It has
not only thoughts, but also a body to hold these
thoughts. It is because of these two golden doors,
over which are written the words, <i>Welsh</i>, <i>Irish</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
that English Literature is likely to produce most
of the great plays which will be acted, and most
of the great novels.</p>

<p>Every Christian and Jewish boy and girl knows
the Bible story of David and Jonathan&mdash;that
Jonathan who loved David as his soul, and David
who loved Jonathan more than a brother can
love. This friendship of a king's son with the
son of a shepherd was very beautiful and tender
and pure. "The Battle at the Ford" is not so
gentle a story, but it is, nevertheless, and despite
the treachery of the Queen and the sad end of
Ferdiad, the David and Jonathan story of Irish
Literature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The men of Ireland settled it that Ferdiad and
Cuchulain should fight the next day. But when
they sent messengers to fetch Ferdiad he would
not come, for he learned that they wanted him
to fight against his friend Cuchulain.</p>

<p>Then Maeve, the Queen, sent the Druids after
him, who by their hurtful poems about Ferdiad
should raise three blisters on his face&mdash;the blisters
of Shame, Blemish, and Reproach.</p>

<p>So Ferdiad had to come to answer the Queen,
Maeve. She offered him great riches if he would
fight against his friend Cuchulain&mdash;speckled
satins and silver and gold, with lands, horses, and
bridles.</p>

<p>But to Maeve Ferdiad replied, "If you offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
me land and sea I would not take them without
the sun and moon."</p>

<p>For he loved his friend Cuchulain so that there
was no wealth which could tempt Ferdiad to go
out against him to wound him.</p>

<p>"But," said Maeve, "you shall have your fill
of the jewels of the earth. Here is my brooch
with its hooked pin and my daughter, Findabair."</p>

<p>"Nay," answered Ferdiad, "these things and
all things like unto them shall remain yours, for
there is nothing I would take to go into battle
against my friend Cuchulain. Nothing shall
come between him and me&mdash;he who is the half
of my heart without fault, and I the half of his
own heart. By my spear, were Cuchulain killed,
I would be buried in his grave&mdash;the one grave for
the two of us! Misfortune on you, Maeve, misfortune
on you for trying to put your face between
us!"</p>

<p>Then Maeve considered how she should stir
him up and thus get her own ends.</p>

<p>Aloud she said to her people, "Is it a true word
Cuchulain spoke?"</p>

<p>"What word was that?" asked Ferdiad, sharply.</p>

<p>"He said," answered Maeve, "that there would
be no wonder in it did you fall in the first trial
of arms against him."</p>

<p>Then was Ferdiad angry. "That had Cuchulain
no right to say! If it be true he said this
thing, then will I fight with him to-morrow!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>At that Fergus left Ferdiad and Maeve, and
went out in his chariot to tell Cuchulain what
had happened.</p>

<p>"I give my word," exclaimed Cuchulain, "for
my friend to come against me is not my wish!"</p>

<p>"Ferdiad's anger is stirred up," said Fergus,
"and he has no fear of you."</p>

<p>"Be quiet," replied Cuchulain, "for I can
stand against him anywhere!"</p>

<p>"It will go hard with you getting the better
of him," answered Fergus, "for he has the strength
of a hundred."</p>

<p>"My word and oath," said Cuchulain, "it is
I who will be victorious over Ferdiad."</p>

<p>Then went Fergus joyfully back to the encampment.
But Ferdiad, gloomy and heavy-hearted,
slept only through the early part of the night.
Toward the end of night he told his driver to
harness his horses.</p>

<p>"Ferdiad," said the driver, "it would be better
for you to stop here, for grief will come of that
meeting with Cuchulain."</p>

<p>Yet the chariot was yoked and they went forward
to the ford, and day and its full light came
upon them there. Then Ferdiad slept while he
waited for the coming of Cuchulain.</p>

<p>With the full light of day Cuchulain himself
rose up, and said to his driver, "Laeg, yoke the
chariot, for the man who comes to meet us to-day
is an early riser."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"The horses are harnessed," answered Laeg.</p>

<p>With that Cuchulain leaped into the chariot,
and about him shouted the people of the gods of
Dana, and the witches and the fairies.</p>

<p>Then Ferdiad's driver heard them coming, the
straining of the harness, the creaking of the
chariot, the ringing of the armor and the shields,
and the thunder of the horses' hoofs.</p>

<p>"Good Ferdiad," said the driver, laying his
hand upon his master, "rise up. Cuchulain comes,
and he is coming not slowly, but quick as the wind
or as water from a high cliff or like swift thunder."</p>

<p>And they saw Cuchulain coming, swooping
down on them like a hawk from a cliff on a day
of hard wind. Cuchulain drew up on the north
side of the ford.</p>

<p>"I am happy at your coming," said Ferdiad.</p>

<p>"Till this day would I have been glad to hear
that welcome," answered Cuchulain; "but now
it is no longer the welcome of a friend."</p>

<p>Then each spoke unfriendly words and each
began to boast.</p>

<p>"Before the setting of the sun to-night," said
Ferdiad, "you will be fighting as with a mountain,
and it is not white that battle will be."</p>

<p>"You are fallen into a gap of danger," answered
Cuchulain, "and the end of your life has come."</p>

<p>"Leave off your boasting," shouted Ferdiad,
"you heart of a bird in a cage, you giggling fellow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>But to this Cuchulain replied, "You were my
heart companion, you were my people, you were
my family&mdash;I never found one who was dearer."</p>

<p>"What is the use of this talk?" asked Ferdiad.</p>

<p>"Good Ferdiad," answered Cuchulain, "it is
not right for you to come out against me through
the meddling of Maeve. Do not break your oath
not to fight with me. Do not break friendship.
We were heart companions, comrades, and sharing
one bed."</p>

<p>And Ferdiad answered: "Do not be remembering
our companionship, for it will not protect you
this day. It is I will give you your first wounds."</p>

<p>Then began they with their casting weapons&mdash;their
round-handled spears and their little quill
spears and their ivory-hilted knives and their
ivory-hafted spears, and these weapons were flying
to and fro like bees on the wing on a summer's
day. Yet good as the throwing was, the defense
was better, and neither hurt the other. There
was no cast that did not hit the protecting shields,
and by noon their weapons were all blunted
against the faces and bosses of the shields.</p>

<p>So they left these weapons and took to their
straight spears. And from the middle of midday
till the fall of evening each threw spears at
the other. But good as the defense was, in that
time each wounded the other.</p>

<p>"Let us leave this, now," said Ferdiad.</p>

<p>Then each came to the other and put his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
around the neck of the other and gave him three
kisses. And that night one inclosure held their
horses and at one fire sat their chariot-drivers.
And of every healing herb that was put on Cuchulain's
wounds Cuchulain sent an equal share
westward across the ford for the wounds of Ferdiad.
And of food and drink Ferdiad sent a fair
share northward to Cuchulain and his men.</p>

<p>And in the morning they rose up and came to
the ford of battle.</p>

<p>"What weapons shall we use to-day?" asked
Cuchulain.</p>

<p>"To-day is your choice, for I made the choice
yesterday," answered Ferdiad.</p>

<p>"Then let us take our great broad spears, for
so by the end of evening shall we be nearer the
end of the fight."</p>

<p>From the twilight of the early morning till the
fall of evening each cut at and wounded the other,
till, were it the custom of birds in their flight to
pass through the bodies of men, they might have
done so on this day.</p>

<p>"Let us stop from this, now," said Cuchulain,
"for our horses and men are tired and down-hearted.
Let us put the quarrel away for a
while."</p>

<p>So they threw their spears into the hands of
their chariot-drivers, and each put his hand
around the neck of the other and gave him three
kisses. And that night they slept on wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
men's pillows their chariot-drivers had made for
them. A full share of every charm and spell used
to cure the wounds of Cuchulain was sent to
Ferdiad. And of food Ferdiad sent a share.</p>

<p>Again early on the morrow they came to the
ford of battle, and there was a dark look on Ferdiad
that day.</p>

<p>"It is bad you are looking to-day," said Cuchulain.</p>

<p>"It is not from fear or dread of you I am looking
this way," answered Ferdiad.</p>

<p>"No one has ever put food to his lips, Ferdiad,
and no one has ever been born for whose sake I
would have hurt you."</p>

<p>"Cuchulain," cried Ferdiad, "it was not you,
but Maeve, who has betrayed us, and now my
word and my name will be worth nothing if I
go back without doing battle with you."</p>

<p>And that day they fought with their swords,
and each hacked at the other from dawn till
evening. When they threw their swords from
them into the hands of their chariot-drivers, their
parting that night was sad and down-hearted.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Ferdiad rose up and
went by himself to the ford, and there clad himself
in his shirt of striped silk with its border of
speckled gold, over that a coat of brown leather,
and on his head a crested helmet of battle. Taking
his strong spear in his right hand and sword
in his left, he began to show off very cunningly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>wonderful feats that were made up that day by
himself against Cuchulain.</p>



<p><a name="i045"></a></p>

<p>But when Cuchulain came to the ford, it was
his turn to choose the weapons for the day. And
they fought all the morning. By midday the
anger of each was hot upon him, and Cuchulain
leaped up onto the bosses of Ferdiad's shield, but
Ferdiad tossed him from him like a bird on the
brink of the ford, or as foam is thrown from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>wave. Then did Cuchulain leap with the quickness
of the wind and the lightness of a swallow,
and lit on the boss of Ferdiad's shield. But Ferdiad
shook his shield and cast Cuchulain from him.
Cuchulain's anger came on him like flame; and
so close was the fight that their shields were
broken and loosened, that their spears were bent
from their points to their hilts; and so close was
the fight that they drove the river from its bed,
and that their horses broke away in fear and
madness.</p>

<p>Then Ferdiad gave Cuchulain a stroke of the
sword and hid it in his body. And Cuchulain
took his spear, Gae Bulg, cast it at Ferdiad, and
it passed through his body so that the point
could be seen.</p>

<p>"O Cuchulain," cried Ferdiad, when Gae
Bulg pierced him, "it was not right that I should
fall by your hand! My end is come, my ribs will
not hold my heart. I have not done well in the
battle."</p>

<p>Then Cuchulain ran toward him and put his
two arms about him, and laid him by the ford
northward. And he began to keen and lament:
"What are joy and shouting to me now? It
is to madness I am driven after the thing I have
done. O Ferdiad, there will never be born among
the men of Connaught who will do deeds equal to
yours!</p>

<p>"O Ferdiad, you were betrayed to your death!
You to die, I to be living. Our parting for ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
is a grief for ever! We gave our word that to the
end of time we would not go against each other.</p>

<p>"Dear to me was your beautiful ruddiness, dear
to me your comely form, dear to me your clear
gray eye, dear your wisdom and your talk, and dear
to me our friendship!</p>

<p>"It was not right you to fall by my hand; it
was not a friendly ending. My grief! I loved
the friend to whom I have given a drink of red
blood. O Ferdiad, this thing will hang over me
for ever! Yesterday you were strong as a mountain.
And now there is nothing but a shadow!"</p>

<small>CÆDMON THE COWHERD</small></h2>


<p>A very great modern poet, Coleridge, who
wrote "The Ancient Mariner," said that
prose was words in their best order, but that
<i>poetry was the best words in their best order</i>. This
is a simple and good definition of poetry. Yet
there is even more than best words in their best
order in the room beyond the door over which
is written <i>Poetry</i>. Perhaps, however, beautiful
words in their best order would always teach us
to find what is beautiful and to love the good. I
do not know. Do you?</p>

<p>Cædmon's poem, written about 670, marks the
beginning of English poetry in Great Britain, for
"Beowulf" was first sung in another land&mdash;the
land of the conquerors of England&mdash;before it was
brought to British soil. The verses of Cædmon's
poetry are as stormy as the sea which beats at
the bottom of the cliffs of Whitby, on which rose
the monastery of Streoneshalh. Cædmon was at
first a servant in this monastery, but when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
power to sing came to him it lifted not only
Cædmon himself to something better than he
had been; it has also lifted men and women ever
since to better ways of thinking and feeling and
to greater happiness than they would ever have
had without English poetry. Bede, who wrote
about Cædmon, said, "He did not learn the art
of poetry from men, nor of men, but from God."
Cædmon sang many songs, chiefly songs about
stories in the Bible. Our first poetry was religious.
"Dark and true and tender is the north," and
true and tender is all great English poetry since
that most precious of all the golden doors was
thrown open in the Great Palace of English
Literature.</p>

<p>Almost more interesting than the stories which
Cædmon resung for the world is the story of the
way the gift of song came to Cædmon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day a little boy stood by a fishing-boat
from which he had just leaped. He dug his toe
in the sand and looked up to the edge of the
rocky cliff above him.</p>

<p>"What dost see, lad?" said his uncle, who was
tossing his catch of fish to the sand; "creatures
of the mist in the clouds yonder?"</p>

<p>"Nay, uncle," answered Finan, "there is no
Grendel in the clouds. Last night at the Hall a
man sang to the harp that Grendel was a moor-treader.
Also he told of the deeds of the hero
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>Beowulf, and he said that Beowulf had killed
Grendel."</p>

<p>Finan's eyes were on the distant moor, which
was the color of flame in the evening light. Already
twinkling above were little stars bright as
the sheen of elves. There, he knew, for everybody
said so, lived elf and giant and monster.
There in the moor pools lived the water-elves.
Across its flame of heather strode mighty march-gangers
like Grendel, and in the dark places of
the mountains lived a dragon, crouched above his
pile of gold and treasure.</p>

<p>There stood the miraculous tree, of great size,
on which were carved the figures of beasts and
birds and strange letters which told what gods
the heathen worshiped before the gentle religion
of Christ was brought to England. There lived
the Wolf-Man, too, so friendless and wild that he
became the comrade of the wolves which howled
in those dark places. There lived a bear, old and
terrible, and the wild boar rooting up acorns with
his huge curved tusks.</p>

<p>Nearer the village was the wolf's-head tree&mdash;more
terrible tree than any in the mysteries of
forest and fen-land. This was the gallows on
which the village folk hung those who did evil.
Finan could see the tree where it stood alone in
the sunset light. And he heard the rough cawing
of ravens as they settled down into its dark
branches to roost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Caw, caw," croaked one raven, "ba-a-d man,
ba-ad man."</p>

<p>"Caw, caw," sang another raven, "ba-ad."</p>

<p>Then they flapped their wings and settled to
their sleep.</p>

<p>"Uncle," Finan said, "I will go up the cliffside."</p>

<p>The fisherman looked up. He heard the chanting
from the church, and saw an immense white
cross upright on the cliff's edge. But he knew
not of what adventure little Finan was thinking.</p>

<p>"Aye," he said, "go. Perhaps you will see the
blessed Hild."</p>

<p>So it came about that little Finan climbed the
cliff on that evening which was to prove a night
wonderful in its miracle. There was born that
night that which, like the love of Christ, has made
children's lives better and happier.</p>

<p>Finan reached the top of the cliff by those
steps which were cut into it, and then took the
main road, paved and straight, which led toward
the Great Hall. He went along slowly under
the apple-trees. He saw a black-haired Welsh
woman draw water. Little children not so big
as Finan were sitting on the steps by their mothers,
who were spinning in their doorways. He passed
a dog gnawing a bone flung to it for its supper.</p>

<p>A cobbler, laying by his tools, looking up, saw
Finan and greeted him. A jeweler was fixing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>ornaments on a huge horn he had polished. Carpenters
were leaving a little cottage which they
were building. The road was full of men&mdash;swineherds
and cowherds, plowboys and wood-choppers
from the forests beyond, gardeners and shepherds&mdash;all
on their way to the Great Hall. Some men
there were in armor, too, their long hair floating
over their shoulders.</p>

<p>Inside the windows, which in those days contained
no window-glass, torches and firelight
would soon begin to flame, and mead would be
passed. Already a loud horn was calling all who
would to come.</p>

<p>Suddenly something sharp stabbed Finan, and
he cried out.</p>

<p>A man, a woman, and a little child came rushing
from one of the household yards, flapping
their garments and screaming: "The bees! The
bees!"</p>

<p>They had just found their precious hive empty.
The bees had swarmed, and unless they could
find them there would be no more sweet-smelling
mead made from honey in that household that
year.</p>

<p>Another bee stung Finan. And there they were
clinging to a low apple bough just above his
head. They hung in a great cluster, like a bunch
of dark grapes.</p>

<p>"Dame," said a cowherd, who was in the road,
to the people who were crying out for their bees,
"yonder lad knows where the bees are."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Finan rubbed his head and looked up at the
angry, humming swarm.</p>

<p>"Aye," he said, and laughed.</p>

<p>"Throw gravel on the swarming bees," called
the cowherd, Cædmon.</p>

<p>The man and woman and Finan took handfuls
of gravel from the roadside and flung them over
the bees, and sang again and again, "Never to
the wood, fly ye wildly more!"</p>

<p>Then they laughed, and the bees swarmed.</p>

<p>"Now," said Cædmon, who was a wise cowherd,
"hang veneria on the hive, and if ye would
have them safe lay on the hive a plant of madder.
Then can naught lure them away."</p>

<p>When they reached the Hall folk were already
eating inside. Little Finan saw Cædmon go in
quietly, for Cædmon was attached to the Abbess
Hild's monastery and had a right to go in and
eat. Inside they were singing for the sake of
mirth, and the torches and firelight were flaming.</p>

<p>Through the open window&mdash;for windows were
always open then, and the word window meant
literally "wind-eye"&mdash;Finan saw the harp being
passed from one to another.</p>

<p>They sang many songs as the harp passed from
hand to hand, songs of war and songs of home.</p>

<p>But when the harp was passed to Cædmon,
who had charmed the bees, he shook his head
sorrowfully, saying that he could not sing, and
got up sad and ashamed and went out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Finan wanted to shout through the window
to him to sing about the bees. He did not
dare, for he was afraid of being discovered. Instead
he followed behind Cædmon. He wished
to ask him why he could not sing. This he did
not dare to do, either, but he went on to the fold
where the cowherd had gone to care for the
cattle. And there on the edge of the fold the little
boy, unseen by the cowherd, fell asleep. Shortly
afterward Cædmon, too, fell asleep.</p>

<p>It must have been near the middle of the night
when the stars one and all were shining and dancing
with the sheen of millions and millions of
elves, and the sea down below the cliff was singing
a mighty lullabye, that little Finan started
wide awake, hearing a voice speak.</p>

<p>"Cædmon," spoke a man who stood beside the
sleeping cowherd, "sing me something."</p>

<p>Cædmon drowsily answered: "I cannot sing anything.
Therefore went I away from the mirth and
came here, for I know not how to sing."</p>

<p>Again the mysterious stranger spoke. "Yet
you could sing."</p>

<p>And Finan heard the sleep-bound voice of
Cædmon ask, "What shall I sing?"</p>

<p>"Sing to me," said the stranger, "the beginning
of all things."</p>

<p>And at once Cædmon began to sing in a strong
voice, and very beautifully, the praise of God
who made this world. And his song had all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>beat of sea waves in it&mdash;sometimes little waves
that lapped gently on the shore and bore in beautiful
shells and jeweled seaweed. But more often
its rhythm was as mighty as ocean waves that
tossed big ships.</p>

<p>Then the wandering stranger, hearing the
beauty of the song, vanished. Cædmon awoke
from his sleep, and he remembered all that he had
sung and the vision that had come to him. And
he was glad. He arose and went to the Abbess
Hild to tell her what had happened to him, the
least of her servants.</p>

<p>In the presence of many wise men did Hild
bid Cædmon tell his dream and sing his verses.
And he did as he was told, and it was plain to
all that an angel had visited Cædmon. The
Abbess Hild took him into the monastery, and
she ordered that everything be done for him.
And Cædmon became the first and one of the
greatest of English poets. And even as Christ
was born in a manger in Bethlehem, English poetry
was born in a cattle-fold in a town which was
called Streoneshalh, which means "Bay of the
Beacon." And to mankind since Cædmon, the
first English poet, English song has been a beacon
to all the world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If you open a book written in the English of
to-day, it is easy to read it&mdash;just as easy as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>understand the speech we use among one another.
But the English of fifteen or sixteen hundred
years ago would be difficult to read. There
is an illustration of this English in a line from
"Deor's Lament":</p>


<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">Thas ofer eode, thisses swa maeg.</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It is easy to pick this out word for word, and see
that it means, "That was overcome (or overpassed),
so may this be." The English in that
Great Palace, some of whose doors are more than
twelve hundred years old, is the same English,
just as the oak-tree two hundred years old is the
same oak-tree, though different, that it was when
planted. But you would find it difficult to read
the English in which Cædmon wrote his great
poems.</p>

<p>Old English poetry, too, seems as different
from the poetry of to-day as the language we speak
seems different from the language they used to
speak. For one thing, old English poetry did
not have rhymes.</p>



<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i4">Little lamb, who made thee?</span>
    <span class="i4">Dost thou know who made thee,</span>
    <span class="i0">Gave thee life and bade thee feed</span>
    <span class="i0">By the stream and o'er the mead;</span>
    <span class="i0">Gave thee clothing of delight,</span>
    <span class="i0">Softest clothing, woolly, bright;</span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<p>This poem was written somewhat over a hundred
years ago by William Blake, but it is modern and
part of that brightest and most beautiful room of
all English poetry&mdash;Nineteenth Century Poetry.
What is a rhyme? You can tell if you will study
this stanza from "The Lamb." You will see
that "thee" of the first line rhymes with "thee"
of the second, that "feed" and "mead" rhyme,
and that "delight" and "bright" rhyme just as
"voice" and "rejoice." Old English poetry was
different, too, in that it did not count the syllables
in a line of poetry. If you drum on the table and
count the syllables of the first and second lines,
you will see that each has six, and the following
six lines have seven syllables each, and the last
two six each. Then if you drum a little more
you will see that each of the first two lines has
three accents or stresses, and the following six
four accents or stresses each.</p>

<p>Then, you ask, what was this old English poetry
like? Even if the syllables were not counted
and there was no rhyme, it had accents just as
our modern poetry has. Every line was divided
into half verses by a pause, as, for example:</p>



<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">Warriors of winters young with words spake.</span>
  </div>
</div>



<p>There are two accented syllables in the first half
of this line, and one in the second. And now, instead
of rhyme, what do you think the old English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
poetry had? Alliteration. That is a big word,
but it is not nearly so difficult as it seems, for it
means simply the repetition of the same letter at
the beginning of two or more words. Here it is,
the letter "w" that is repeated. It was poetry
with alliteration and stress which little Finan
heard on that night so long ago when the angel
came to Cædmon and commanded him to sing.</p>

<small>THE SHEPHERD OF LAUDERDALE</small></h2>


<p>After Cædmon's day there were more and
more religious poets. Very often the men who
wrote the poetry and prose during the time of
Cædmon and of Cuthbert lived in monasteries,
where the life was a religious life. In the Great
Palace of English Literature there is a pretty
story told about Ealdhelm, who was a young man
when Cædmon died. This young man later became
the Abbot of Malmesbury. He was not
only a religious poet, but he also made songs and
could sing them to music. He traveled from town
to town, and, finding that the men at the fairs did
not come to church as they should, he would stand
on the bridge and sing songs to them in the English
tongue, persuading them thus to come to hear
the word of God. Living at this same time&mdash;that
is, during the latter half of the seventh century&mdash;was
St. Cuthbert, not so great a scholar as Ealdhelm,
but as great a wanderer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is a little valley between England and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Scotland called Lauderdale&mdash;a little valley watered
by a river which flows into the Tweed.
There Cuthbert did not keep the flocks of his
father as did David, yet, like David, he was a
warrior lad. Day and night Cuthbert lived in
the open, shepherding the sheep of many masters.</p>

<p>There was not among the lads of that time
a boy more active, more daring than Cuthbert.
He could walk on his hands, turn somersaults,
fight boldly, and become a victor in almost every
race. There was no other boy so active but that
Cuthbert was better at games and sports. And
when all the others were tired he would ask
whether there was not some one who could go on
playing. Then suddenly a swelling came on his
knee and the poor little boy could play no longer,
and had to be carried in and out, up and down, by
attendants. This continued until one day a horseman,
clothed in white garments and riding a horse
of incomparable beauty, appeared before the sick
boy and cured his knee. Little Cuthbert was now
able to walk about once more, but never again did
he play the games he used to play.</p>

<p>Not far from where Cuthbert lived was the
monastery of Tiningham, by the mouth of the
river Tyne. Some of the monks were bringing
down on rafts wood which they had spent a long
time felling and sawing up. They were almost
opposite the monastery and were just about to
draw the wood to the shore, when a great wind
came up from the west and drove the rafts out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
toward the sea. There were five of them, and so
quickly did they drift away that it was not more
than a few minutes before they began to look in
the distance as small as five little birds. Those
upon the rafts were in much danger of losing their
lives. Those in the monastery came out and
prayed upon the shore for them. But the five
rafts that now looked like the tiniest of birds
went on drifting out to sea. And the populace,
which had been heathens very lately, began to
jest at the monks because their prayers were in
vain.</p>

<p>Then said Cuthbert: "Friends, you do wrong
to speak evil of those you see hurried away to
death. Would it not be better to pray for their
safety?"</p>

<p>"No!" shouted the people, angrily. "They took
away our old worship, and you can see that nothing
comes of the new."</p>

<p>At this the young Cuthbert began to pray,
bowing his head to the ground. And the winds
were turned around and brought the rafts in
safety to the shore of the monastery.</p>

<p>Like David, this boy Cuthbert was very near
to God, and one night, while keeping the sheep
of his masters, he saw angels descending from
heaven. Cuthbert was on a remote mountain
with other shepherds, and keeping not only his
sheep, but also the vigil of prayer, when a light
streamed down from heaven and broke the thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
darkness. Then Cuthbert made up his mind to
serve God by entering a monastery.</p>

<p>One day he was on a journey on horseback
when he was not quite fifteen years old. He
turned aside to the farmstead which he saw at
some distance, and entered the house of a very
good woman. He wanted to rest himself. But
even more he wanted to get food for his horse.
The woman urged him to let her prepare dinner
for him. But Cuthbert would not eat, for it was
a fast-day.</p>

<p>"Consider," said the woman, "that on your
journey you will find no village nor habitation of
man; for indeed a long journey is before you,
nor can you possibly accomplish it before sunset.
Wherefore, I beg of you to take some food before
setting out, lest you be obliged to fast all day, or
perhaps even until to-morrow."</p>

<p>But Cuthbert would not break his fast. Night
came on and he saw that he could not finish his
journey, and there was no house anywhere in
which to take shelter. As he went on, however,
he noticed some shepherds' huts which had been
roughly thrown together in the summer. He entered
one of these to pass the night there, tied
his horse to the wall, and set before the horse a
bundle of hay to eat. Suddenly Cuthbert noticed
that his horse was raising his head and pulling
at the thatching of the hut. And as the horse
drew the thatch down there fell out also a folded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
napkin. In the napkin was wrapped the half of
a loaf of bread, yet warm, and a piece of meat&mdash;enough
for Cuthbert's supper.</p>

<p>At last, followed by his squire, and with his
lance in hand, the youthful shepherd-warrior,
then but fifteen years old, appeared before the
gates of the monastery of Melrose. For Cuthbert
had decided to serve God in a religious life
rather than upon the battle-field.</p>

<p>There was not a village so far away, or a mountain
so steep, or a cottage so poverty-stricken, but
that the boy Cuthbert, strong and energetic,
visited it. Most often he traveled on horseback;
but there were places so rough and wild they were
not to be reached on horseback. These places
along the coast he visited in a boat. Cuthbert
thought nothing of hunger and thirst and cold.
From the Solway to the Forth he covered Scotland
with his pilgrimages. This, of course, was
in the seventh century&mdash;a long time ago&mdash;yet
stories are still told there of the wonderful work
of Cuthbert.</p>

<p>While he was young in the life of the monastery
it was Cuthbert's good fortune to entertain an
angel unawares, as, perhaps, we all do sometimes.
At the monastery Cuthbert, so pleasant and winning
were his manners, was appointed guest-master.
Going out one morning from the inner
buildings of the monastery to the guest-chamber,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>he found a young man seated there. He welcomed
him with the usual forms of kindness, gave
him water to wash his hands, himself bathed his
feet and wiped them with a towel and warmed
them. He begged the young man not to go forward
on his journey until the third hour, when he
might have breakfast. He thought the stranger
must have been wearied by the night journey and
the snow. But the stranger was very unwilling
to stay until Cuthbert urged him in the Divine
Name. Immediately after the prayers of tierce&mdash;or
the third hour&mdash;were said, Cuthbert laid the
table and offered the stranger food.</p>

<p>"Refresh thyself, master, until I return with
some new bread, for I expect it is ready baked
by this time."</p>

<p>But when he returned the guest whom he had
left at the table had gone. Although a recent
snowfall had covered the ground, and Cuthbert
looked for his footprints, none were to be found.
On entering the room again, there came to him
a very sweet odor, and he saw lying beside him
three loaves of bread, warm and of unwonted
whiteness and beauty.</p>

<p>"Lo," said Cuthbert, "this was an angel of
God who came to feed and not to be fed. These
are such loaves as the earth cannot produce, for
they surpass lilies in whiteness, roses in smell, and
honey in flavor."</p>

<p>By all human beings and creatures was Cuthbert
beloved. He usually spent the greater part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of the night in prayer. One night one of the
brothers of the monastery followed him to find
out where he went when he left the monastery.
St. Cuthbert went out to the shore and entered
the cold water of the sea till it was up to his arms
and neck. And there in praises, with the sound
of the waves in his ears, he spent the night.
When dawn was drawing near he came out of the
water and finished his prayer upon the shore.
While he was doing this two seals came from out
of the depths of the sea, warmed his feet with
their breath and dried them with their hair.
And when Cuthbert's feet were warm and dry
he stood up and blessed the seals and sent them
back into the sea, wherein these humble creatures
swam about praising God.</p>

<small>THE BOY WHO WON A PRIZE</small></h2>


<p>You know what sort of stories Bede was fond
of telling&mdash;of course in Latin. If you should
be asked with whom English prose began, I think
it would be safe to say, "With Bede, who wrote
the life of St. Cuthbert and the Ecclesiastical
History." But that is not why you should say
that Bede began English prose, but because at
his death he was busy finishing a book written in
English and called <i>Translation of the Gospel of
St. John</i>.</p>

<p>When his last day came the good old man called
all his scholars about him.</p>

<p>"There is still a chapter wanting," said the
youth who always took down all of Bede's dictation,
"and it is hard for thee to question thyself
longer."</p>

<p>"It is easily done," answered Bede; "take thy
pen and write quickly."</p>

<p>And all day long they wrote.</p>

<p>When twilight came the boy cried out, "There
is still one sentence unwritten, dear master."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Write it quickly," answered the master.</p>

<p>"It is finished now," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Thou sayest truth," came the answer, "all is
finished now."</p>

<p>Singing the praise of God, his scholars and the
boy scribe about him, he died. Alas that this
English book that he bravely finished has been
lost!</p>

<p>Bede was born about 673 and lived most of his
life in the monastery at Jarrow in Northumbria
in the north of England. With Bede's death the
home of English prose literature was changed
from the north to the south, from Northumbria
to Wessex, where there lived a noble boy called
Alfred. Asser, the man who was his secretary
after the boy grew up, has written a life of Alfred.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the very first this little boy was full of
promise and very attractive. This fact is rather
hard on some of us, is it not, who find it difficult
to be good and to win the confidence of grown-up
people. But the confidence of others is precisely
what the boy Alfred did win, and it was
not because he was a molly-coddle, for no young
prince ever swung a battle-ax more lustily than
did Alfred.</p>

<p>When he was a little bit of a chap only five
years old, he was taken to Rome to see the Pope.
Alfred was born in 849 at the town of Wantage,
so you know what year it was when he went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Rome. The Pope took a great fancy to him and
hallowed him as his "bishop's son." Just how
old this charming boy was when he began to read
we do not know. At that time, of course, all
boys read Latin, for there were no English books
to read. But there is an old English couplet&mdash;a
couplet is two lines of verse with a rhyme at the
end of each line&mdash;which may tell the story of
Alfred's reading:</p>



<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">At writing he was good enough, and yet as he telleth me,</span>
    <span class="i0">He was more than ten years old ere he knew his A B C.</span>
  </div>
</div>



<p>Alfred may have been younger or older than
this. We don't know, and the probability is that
we never shall know. This little boy was much
loved by his father, King Ethelwulf, and his
mother, Queen Osburh. He had many brothers
and sisters, and was himself the fifth child. But
he was a finer-looking boy than the others, and
more graceful in his way of speaking and in his
manners.</p>

<p>From the time that he was a tiny child he loved
to know things. And yet his parents and nurses
allowed him to remain untaught in reading and
writing until he was quite a big boy. But at
night, when the gleemen sang songs to the harp
in the royal villa, Alfred listened attentively.
He had memorized very early some splendid old
English songs, such as "Beowulf." He knew all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>about Grendel, and all about the death of the warrior
Beowulf after his battle with the dragon.
And he had listened to gentler songs, like the one
of the cowherd, Cædmon. He listened to the
singing of poems which were full of the sea and
full of war. Saints, warriors, and pirates were
the chief heroes. A Roman poet, thinking of the
warriors and pirates, called the English people
"sea wolves." All their poetry was full of the sea,
and it is still true that the English love the sea.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But you must not think of these people, in the
midst of whom Alfred was born, as just warriors.
They loved their homes, and their poetry is full
of love for their families and for the dear old home-place,
wherever it happened to be. Besides home-loving
poetry, the gleemen sang many religious
poems to which the little Alfred listened. Among
them was the story of Cædmon, as I have said.
We hear, too, of warrior saints, good men who did
not go out to slay a fire-spewing dragon lying on
a heap of gold, as did Beowulf, but who taught
them how to fight the dragon of evil which lurks
somewhere near or within us all the time.</p>

<p>It is this sort of golden and every-day victory
that not only Cædmon, the cowherd, sings,
but also Cynewulf, who lived during the last
half of the eighth century. Cynewulf was a
minstrel at the court of one of the Northumbrian
kings&mdash;just such a minstrel or gleeman as Alfred
sometimes listened to on many a night when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
was committing to memory some stirring or beautiful
Anglo-Saxon poem. This poet-singer loved
the sea with all his heart, and his poetry is full of
this love. And in our own day, eleven centuries
later, Tennyson wrote poems in their spirit not
unlike Old English poems. There is one called
"The Sailor Boy" which resembles an Anglo-Saxon
poem called "The Seafarer." It is a spirited
little poem and begins:</p>



<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">He rose at dawn and, fired with hope,</span>
    <span class="i2">Shot o'er the sultry harbour-bar,</span>
    <span class="i0">And reached the ship and caught the rope,</span>
    <span class="i2">And whistled to the morning star.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">God help me! save I take my part</span>
    <span class="i2">Of danger on the roaring sea,</span>
    <span class="i0">A devil rises in my heart,</span>
    <span class="i2">Far worse than any death to me.</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>That devil is, of course, the devil of idleness, of
uselessness. These stanzas are worth memorizing.
You can see the spirit of a poet sometimes has a
very long life. Here is one of the Old English
riddles:</p>


<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">On the sand I stayed, by the sea-wall near,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">All beside the surge-inflowing! Firm I sojourned there,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Where I first was fastened. Only few of men<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Watched among the waste where I wonned on the earth.<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">But the brown-backed billow, at each break of day,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">With its water-arms enwrapt me! Little weened I then,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">That I e'er should speak, in the after-days,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Mouthless o'er the mead-bench....<br /></span>
  </div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<p>What do you think that meant? A reed flute&mdash;a
little flute on which one played a song.</p>

<p>When Christianity came to England, as it did
in 597 with St. Augustine, almost three hundred
years before little Alfred was born, it made men
care less for warfare and more for Christ. It is
difficult to do what Christ told us to do&mdash;love one
another, and at the same time fight one another.
And that we should love one another was the great
new message of Christianity. Christ was in men's
minds, however, in those olden days, not only our
gentle Saviour, but also a hero who went forth
to war.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Alfred knew all about warfare, but it was not
for warfare that this gentle boy and brave man
cared most. One day his noble mother, Osburh,
showed him and his brothers a book of poetry
written in English.</p>

<p>"Whichever of you," she said, "shall the soonest
learn this volume shall have it for his own."</p>

<p>This book was a very beautiful book with an
illuminated letter at the beginning of the volume.
An illuminated letter is usually bright with gold
as well as with other colors. Of course the boy
Alfred wanted this wonderful book.</p>

<p>He said before all his brothers, who were older
than he, "Will you really give that book to one
of us, that is to say to him who can first understand
and repeat it to you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," answered his mother, smiling, and assuring
him that it was so.</p>

<p>Alfred thereupon took the book from her hand
and went to his master to read it. And it was not
so very long before he had it all by heart. Then
one day he brought the book to his mother and
recited it. And so well did he do that he received
the gift as his mother had promised him he should.</p>

<p>We have taken a look through the golden door
over which is written <i>Old English Poetry</i>. We
know something of what the boy Alfred learned
from the book his mother gave him.</p>

<p>By that time he had grown to be a large boy.
When he was still a little boy he had been taken
from his nurses and taught the use of arms and
how to ride. All his training was teaching him
how to be a soldier. Yet there was something for
which Alfred cared even more. All about them
in those days were the Danes, the fiercest of fighting-men.
Government, the gentle religion of
Christ, peace, had been almost dislodged by these
fierce, heathen Danes. Yet in the midst of the
war-filled years of his boyhood and young manhood
Alfred was dreaming of what English books, of
what education in their own tongue, might do for
his people.</p>

<p>And even in war times they were very busy
just getting things together in order to live. They
had to have food, they had to be warm, they had
to have houses and clothes. In the woods they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
had pigs&mdash;wild-looking swine with tusks. In the
fields they had cattle and sheep and chickens.
From the sea they took fish. They made butter
and cheese, ale and mead, candles, leather from
skins, and they wove cloth and silk. They kept
bees, too, as you know from what happened to
little Finan in the story of Cædmon. Besides
all these things they had their carpenter's work,
their blacksmith's, their baker's, hunting, woodcutting,
the making of weapons, and a hundred
and one other employments.</p>

<p>Still, despite all the warfare and the work,
Alfred, when he became king in 871, had time to
do a great deal for the education of the boys and
girls of those stirring days. The young king wrote
in English and translated from Latin into English
so that the people might have books in their own
tongue. And since Bede's translation of the
Gospel of St. John was lost, Alfred must be called
the true "father of English prose." Just as
Whitby and the stall in which Cædmon saw the
vision and learned how to sing was the cradle
of English poetry, so was Winchester the cradle
of English prose. To accomplish this work the
good king brought scholars from all over the world.
Asser, his secretary and biographer, has compared
Alfred to a most productive bee which flew here
and there asking questions as he went. He made
it possible for every free-born youth to learn to
read and write English perfectly. Indeed, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
wonderful king made himself into a schoolmaster
and took on the direction of a school in his own
court. He translated from well-known books
into English, among others Bede's <i>History</i> and
Pope Gregory's <i>Pastoral Care</i>. Although he freed
his people from the fierce Danes, through his love
for a book he did more for his own times and for
all times&mdash;more, almost, than any other English
boy has ever grown up to do.</p>

<small>A FISHERMAN'S BOY</small></h2>


<p>When we say that we are English-speaking, it
seems as if it were not necessary to say more
than that. But the more we wander about in the
Great Palace of English Literature opening golden
doors, the more do we realize that we cannot say
that this palace was built by English hands alone.
No, the men who built it were not only English,
they were, as you know already, Welsh, Irish,
Scotch. Indeed, the very word "English" was
brought to England by an invader, just as the
word "America" was brought to the North American
continent by a discoverer. Not only was this
Palace of English Literature built by those who
were Welsh, Irish, and Scotch, as well as English,
but also by Danes and Normans.</p>

<p>The English came to Britain in 449. About
three hundred and fifty years later (790) the Danes
began to ravage Northumbria, which you have
come to know through the story of Cædmon the
cowherd. But the Danes were of English stock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
so to speak, and they neither changed the language
nor altered things in the life of boys and girls and
men and women. After all it was much the same
life after they came as it was before. They brought
with them some stories&mdash;just as the English
"Beowulf." Among the Danish-English stories
were "Havelok the Dane" and "King Horn,"
both written down about 1280, but told and sung
much before that time.</p>

<p>In her early days before she became a great
world power, England had many conquerors. Not
only the English and the Danes, but also the Normans
were her conquerors in 1066 under William
the Conqueror. English story-telling, as, for
example, Malory's "Morte d'Arthur," could never
have been the same without the Norman or
French influence. If we pick up a handful of so-called
English words, we shall see that some of
these words are English, others are French, and
still others Latin in their origin. But the Norman
spoke French only for a while in England.
He soon left the speaking and writing
of French for that of English. However, there
are many beautiful words, many strong words,
many words of customs and manners which we
should not find in the Great Palace of English
Literature but for the conquerors who came to
England.</p>

<p>There are several manuscripts in which the
story of Havelok is found. But the one which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
written in an English dialect shows best how old
the story is.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a King whose name was Aethelwold,
whose only heir was a tiny little girl. And
the little girl's name was Goldborough. Alas, the
King found he must die and leave his little girl
fatherless! So he called to him the wisest and
mightiest of his earls. The name of this Earl was
Godrich. And the King made the Earl promise
that he would guard his little girl until she was
twenty years old, and that then he would give her
in marriage to the fairest and strongest man alive.</p>

<p>But when the Earl Godrich saw how lovely little
Goldborough was going to be, and knew that he
would have to give up the kingdom to her before
long, he was angry, and took her from Winchester
to Dover on the English seacoast and shut little
Goldborough up in a castle so that she could not
get out.</p>

<p>In Denmark, just about this time, there lived
a King whose name was Birkabeyn who had one
boy and two sweet little girls. He, too, realized
that he had to die. So he called to him his wisest
Earl, a man by the name of Godard, and charged
him to care for his children until Havelok, the boy,
was old enough to rule the land. But this wicked
Earl shut little Swanborow and Helfled up in a
castle and had them killed.</p>

<p>And Godard was just about to kill Havelok,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>too, when he bethought him he would have somebody
else do this terrible deed. The wicked Earl
sent for a fisherman who would, he knew, do
his will.</p>

<p>"Grim," said the wicked Earl, "to-morrow I
will make thee rich if thou wilt take this child
and throw him into the sea to-night."</p>

<p>Grim took the boy Havelok and bound him and
gagged him and took him home in a black bag.
When Grim carried the sack into his cottage,
Dame Leve, his wife, was so frightened that she
dropped the sack her husband had handed to her,
and cracked poor little Havelok's head against a
stone.</p>

<p>They let the boy lie this way until midnight,
when it would be dark enough for Grim to drown
Havelok in the sea. Leve was just bringing Grim
some clothes that he might put on to go out and
drown the King's son, when they saw a light shining
about the child.</p>

<p>"What is this light?" cried Dame Leve. "Rise
up, Grim."</p>

<p>In haste the fisherman rose and they went over
to the child, about whose head shone a clear light,
from whose mouth came rays of light like sunbeams.
It was as if many candles were burning
in that tiny fisherman's hut. They unbound the
boy and they found on his right shoulder a king's
mark, bright and fair like the lights.</p>

<p>They were overcome by what Godard had done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>and had almost led them to do. They fell upon
their knees before the little boy and promised to
feed and clothe him. And so they did, and they
were very good to him and kept him from all harm.
But Grim and his wife became frightened, for fear
that Godard would discover that they had not
drowned the child and would hang them. Thereupon
Grim sold all that he had, sheep, cow, horse,
pigs, goat, geese, hens&mdash;everything, in short, that
was his. Taking his money, he put his wife, his
three little sons, and two pretty little girls and
Havelok into his fishing-boat and they set sail for
England.</p>

<p>The north wind blew and drove them down
upon the coast of England near the river Humber,
and there Grim landed, and the place is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Grimsby to this day. Then Grim set himself to
his old occupation of fishing, and he caught
sturgeon, whale, turbot, salmon, seal, porpoise,
mackerel, flounder, plaice, and thornback. And
he and his sons carried the fish about in baskets
and sold them.</p>

<p>Yet while Grim fed his family well, Havelok
lay at home and did naught. And when Havelok
stopped to think about that, he was ashamed, for
he was a fine, strong boy.</p>

<p>"Work is no shame," said the King's son to
himself.</p>

<p>And the next day he carried to market as much
fish as four men could. And every bit of fish did
he sell and brought back the money, keeping not
a farthing for himself. Alas! there came a famine
about this time, and Grim had great fear on Havelok's
account lest the boy starve.</p>

<p>"Havelok," said Grim, "our meat is long since
gone. For myself it does not matter, but I fear
for thee. Thou knowest how to get to Lincoln,
and there they will give thee a chance to earn thy
food. Since thou art naked, I will make thee a
coat from my sail."</p>

<p>This he did, and with the coat on and barefoot
the King's son found his way to Lincoln. For two
days the lad had no food. On the third day he
heard some one crying, "Bearing-men, bearing-men,
come here!" Havelok leaped forward to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>Earl's cook and bore the food to the castle. Another
time he lifted a whole cart-load of fish and
bore it to the castle.</p>

<p>The cook looked him over and said: "Wilt thou
work for me? I will feed thee gladly."</p>

<p>"Feed me," answered Havelok, "and I will
make thy fire burn and wash thy dishes."</p>

<p>And because Havelok was a strong lad and a
good boy, as all kings' sons are not, he worked
hard from that day forth. He bore all the food
in and carried all the wood and the water, and
worked as hard as if he were a beast. And he was
a merry lad, too, for he knew how to hide his
griefs. And the old story says that all who saw
him loved him, for he was meek and strong and
fair. But still he had nothing but the wretched
coat to wear. So the cook took pity on him and
bought him span-new clothes and gave him stockings
and shoes. And when he had put them on
he looked the King's son he was. At the Lincoln
games he was "like a mast," taller and straighter
than any youth there. In wrestling he overcame
every one. Yet he was known for his gentleness.
Never before had Havelok seen stone-putting, but
when his master told him to try, Havelok threw
the stone twelve feet beyond what any one else
could do.</p>

<p>The story of the stone-putting was being told
in castle and hall when Earl Godrich heard it, and
said to himself that here was the tallest, strongest,
and fairest man alive, and he would fulfil his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
promise and get rid of Goldborough, the King's
daughter, by giving her to Havelok, whom he
thought to be just a cook's boy. Now Havelok
did not wish to marry any more than did Goldborough,
but they were forced to. And when
they were married Havelok knew not whither they
could go, for he saw that Godrich hated them and
that their lives were not safe.</p>

<p>Therefore they went on foot to Grimsby, and
royal was their welcome. Grim, the fisherman,
had died.</p>

<p>But his five children fell on their knees and
said: "Welcome, dear lord. Stay here and all
is thine."</p>

<p>And that night as they lay on their bed in the
fisherman's hut, Goldborough discovered, because
of the bright light which came from the mouth of
Havelok, that he was a King's son. And it was
not long after this they all set sail for Denmark,
so that Havelok, with the help of Grim's sons and
many others, might win back the kingdom of
Denmark.</p>

<p>It was in the house of Bernard Brown, the magistrate
of the Danish town, that sixty strong thieves,
clad in wide sleeves and closed capes, attacked
him. Bernard Brown seized an ax and leaped to
the door to defend his home.</p>

<p>One of the thieves shouted at him, "We will go
in at this door despite thee."</p>

<p>And he broke the door asunder with a boulder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Whereupon Havelok took the great bar from
across the door. And with the bar he slew several,
yet the thieves had wounded him in many
places, when Grim's sons came upon the scene to
defend their lord and saw the thieves treating
Havelok as a smith does his anvil. Like madmen
the three sons of Grim leaped into the fight, and
they fought until not one of the thieves was left
alive.</p>

<p>When Earl Ubbe heard of this he rode down to
Bernard Brown's. Then he heard the story of
Havelok's bravery and of the terrible wounds he
had received, so that Bernard Brown feared he
might die because of them.</p>

<p>"Fetch Havelok quickly," commanded Ubbe.
"If he can be healed, I myself will dub him
knight."</p>

<p>When a leech saw the wounds of Havelok he
told Ubbe that they could be cured.</p>

<p>"Come forth now," said Ubbe to Havelok,
"thou and Goldborough and thy three servants."</p>

<p>And with rejoicing did Ubbe bring them to his
city. And about the middle of the night Ubbe
saw a great light in the tower where Havelok was
sleeping. He peered through a crack and he saw
that the "sunny gleam" came from Havelok's
mouth. It was as if a hundred and seven candles
were burning, and on Havelok's shoulder was a
clear, shining cross.</p>

<p>"He is Birkabeyn's heir," said Ubbe, "for never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
in Denmark was brother so like to brother as this
fair man is like the dead King."</p>

<p>And Earl Ubbe and his men fell at Havelok's
feet and awoke him. And very happy was Havelok,
and thankful to God. And then came barons
and warriors and thanes and knights and common
men, and all swore fealty to Havelok. With a
bright sword Ubbe dubbed Havelok knight and
made him King. And the three sons of Grim
were also made knights. Thereat were all men
happy, and they wrestled and played, played the
harp and the pipe, read romances from a book,
and sang old tales. There was every sort of sport
and plenty of food.</p>

<p>Finally they all, a thousand knights and five
thousand men, set forth that Havelok might take
vengeance on the wicked Earl Godard. There
was a hard fight, but at last they caught and bound
Earl Godard. And he was hung on the gallows
and died there. Such was the end of one who betrayed
his trust.</p>

<p>The wicked Earl Godrich in England, who had
robbed Goldborough of her kingdom, heard that
Havelok was become King of Denmark and also
that he was come to Grimsby. So he gathered
all his army together and there was a great battle.
And the battle was going against Havelok, when
the wicked hand of Godrich was struck off. After
that Havelok and his men were victorious. Then
did they condemn the Earl Godrich to death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
And he was bound to an ass and led through
London and burned at the stake. Such was the
end of one who betrayed his trust.</p>

<p>And after that Havelok and Goldborough reigned
in England for sixty years. So great was the
love of the King and Queen for each other that
all marveled at it. Neither was happy away from
the other. And never were they angry, for their
love for each other was always new.</p>

<small>THE WEREWOLF</small></h2>


<p>In the Great Palace of English Literature over
one of the golden doors hangs a horn of ivory,
and a sword of which the name is Durendal.
Above that door is written <i>Chanson de Roland</i>,
which means the Song of Roland. Often in the
stillness of the early morning or at dusk the Great
Palace rings faintly with the music from that
ivory horn which belonged to Roland, and which
he sounded for the last time in the Pass of Roncevaux.
Or there is heard the clinking of Durendal
against the stone of the palace walls&mdash;no doubt
the wind stirring it where it hangs beside the door
it guards.</p>

<p>"Chanson de Roland!" You see the story is
French. The Normans brought it with them
when they came to conquer Britain in 1066 under
William of Normandy. Before the soldiers of
William, the minstrel, Taillefer, rode singing of
"Charlemagne, and of Roland, and of Oliver, and
the vassals who fell at Roncevaux."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Roland, comrade," said Oliver, "blow thy
horn of ivory, and Charles shall hear it and bring
hither again his army, and ... succor us."</p>

<p>"Nay, first will I lay on with Durendal, the
good sword girded at my side."</p>

<p>"Roland, comrade," urged Oliver, "blow thy
horn of ivory, that Charles may hear it."</p>

<p>"God forbid that they should say I sounded my
horn for dread of the heathen."</p>

<p>"Prithee look!" begged Oliver. "They are
close upon us. Thou wouldst not deign to sound
thy horn of ivory. Were the King here we should
suffer no hurt."</p>

<p>Oliver was wise and Roland was brave, and the
song that the minstrel Taillefer chanted before
the conquering hosts of William of Normandy
was a wonderful, stirring song. No doubt there
flows in English veins to-day much of the courage
of Roland and the wisdom of Oliver. Although
the English continued English, yet for a long time
following the conquest of England by the Normans
songs were sung in French rather than in
English. And ready and witty was all that was
written down in French, for the literature of the
Normans was as brightly colored as a jewel and
not grand and melancholy as was that of the
Anglo-Saxons. "Beowulf" was the battle song
of the Anglo-Saxons, the "Song of Roland" that
of the Normans. Melancholy was the poem of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>"Beowulf." White and clear, stirring and flashing
in the sunshine was the "Chanson de Roland,"
even as Roland's beloved sword Durendal, which
is heard clinking against the stone of the Great
Palace of English Literature.</p>

<p>But "Roland" represented only a fraction of
the story-telling in the French poetry of that time.
The most exquisite and delightful story-teller of
that twelfth century collected and wrote here
charming stories on English soil and dedicated
them to Henry II., who died in 1189. Her
name was Marie de France, and of her lays a
rival poet wrote:</p>


<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">All love them much and hold them dear,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Baron, count and chevalier,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Applaud their form and take delight<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">To hear them told by day and night.<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">In chief, these tales the ladies please;<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">They listen glad their hearts to ease.<br /></span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>Marie de France's lays are based on British tradition.
There are many of these delightful stories.
Among the most interesting of them is "The
Werewolf."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Once upon a time in the days of King Arthur&mdash;for
later there are some lines in Malory's "Morte
d'Arthur" which tells us that this story must
have been true&mdash;there lived a man who for part
of the week was a wolf&mdash;that is, he had the form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>and the appetite of a wolf, and was called a werewolf.
But nobody knew that he was a werewolf
for three days in the week. Not even his wife,
whom he loved well and devotedly, knew what
happened to her husband while he was away from
her these three days every week.</p>

<p>It vexed the wife very much that she did not
know, but she was afraid to question her husband,
lest he be angry. At last one day she did question
him.</p>

<p>"Ask me no more," replied the husband, "for
if I answered you you would cease to love me."</p>

<p>Nevertheless she gave him no peace until he
had told her that three days in the week, because
of a spell which was over him, he was forced to
be a werewolf, and that when he felt the change
coming over him he hid himself in the very thickest
part of the forest.</p>

<p>Then the wife demanded to know what became
of his clothes, and he answered that he laid them
aside. The wife asked where he put them. He
begged her not to ask him, for only the garments
made it possible for him to return to human shape
again. But the wife cried and begged until the
knight, her husband, had told her all.</p>

<p>"Wife," he said, "inside the forest on a crossroad
is a chapel. Near the chapel under a shrub
is a stone. Beneath the stone is a hole, and in
that hole do I hide my clothes until the enchantment
makes it possible for me to take my human
shape again."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>Now the wife was not a good wife. Instead of
trying to help her husband to get free from the
wolf shape he had to assume three days in every
week, thereafter she loathed him and was afraid
of him. And what is worse still, she betrayed him
to another knight. She took this other knight
into her confidence and told him where her husband
hid his clothes when the spell came upon
him and he took the form of a wolf. Thereupon
the knight to whom she had told this dreadful
secret stole the clothes, and they hid them where
the poor wolf could never find them again. After
that these two wicked people were married, while
the poor wolf wandered about in the forest, grieving,
for he had loved his wife well and truly.</p>

<p>Some time after this the King was hunting one
day in the forest, and his hounds gave chase to a
wolf. At last, when the wretched beast was in
danger of being overtaken by the hounds and torn
into a thousand pieces, he fled to the King, seized
him by the stirrup, and licked his foot submissively.</p>

<p>The King was astonished. He called his companions,
and they drove off the dogs, for the King
would not have the wolf harmed. But when they
started to leave the forest the wolf followed the
King and would not be driven away. The King
was much pleased, for he had taken a great liking
to the wolf. He therefore made a pet of the lonely
beast, and at night he slept in the King's own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
chamber. All the courtiers came to love the
wolf, too, for he was a gentle wolf and did no one
any harm.</p>

<p>A long time had passed when one day the King
had occasion to hold a court. His barons came
from far and near, and among them the knight
who had betrayed the werewolf. No sooner did
the wolf see him than he sprang at him to kill
him. And had the King not called the wolf off
he would have torn the false knight to pieces.
Every one was astonished that this gentle beast
should show such rage. But after the court was
over and as time went on they forgot the beast's
savage act.</p>

<p>At length the King decided to make a tour
throughout his kingdom. And he took the wolf
with him, for that was his custom. Now the
werewolf's false wife heard that the King was
to spend some time in the part of the country
where she lived. So she begged for an audience.
But no sooner did she enter the presence-chamber
than the wolf sprang at her and bit off
her nose.</p>

<p>The courtiers were going to slay the beast, but
a wise man stayed their weapons.</p>

<p>"Sire," said the councilor, "we have all caressed
this wolf and he has never done us any harm.
This lady was the wife of a man you held dear,
but of whose fate we none of us know anything.
Take my counsel and make this lady answer your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
questions, so shall we come to know why the wolf
sprang at her."</p>

<p>This was done. The false knight who had married
her was brought also, and they told all the
wickedness they had done to the poor wolf. Then
the King caused the wolf's stolen clothes to be
fetched. But the wolf acted as if he did not see
the clothes.</p>

<p>"Sire," said the councilor, "if this beast is a
werewolf he will not change back into his human
shape until he is alone."</p>

<p>They left him alone in the King's chamber, and
put the clothes beside him. Then they waited
for a long time. Lo, when they entered the chamber
again, there lay the long-lost knight in a deep
sleep on the King's bed! Quickly did the King
run to him and embrace him, and after that he
restored to him all his lost lands, and he banished
the false wife and her second husband from the
country. And they who were banished lived in a
strange land, and all the girls among their children
and grandchildren were without noses.</p>

<small>AT GEOFFREY'S WINDOW</small></h2>


<p>Among all the golden doors in the Great Palace
of English Literature about which we are
coming to know something, and through some of
which we have already passed, there was one
golden window on the stairway of the palace.
This window on the stairway of the palace looked
out upon a busy town and down upon the windings
of the river Wye, and off upon hills and upon the
ruins of a wonderful old abbey called Tintern
Abbey, about which, some six hundred years
later, an English poet called William Wordsworth
was to write a poem called "Tintern Abbey."
Wordsworth wrote "We Are Seven," and also
this little poem about a butterfly:</p>


<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">I've watched you now a full half-hour,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Self-poised upon that yellow flower;<br /></span>

    <span class="i0">I know not if you sleep or feed.<br /></span>

    <span class="i0">Sweet childish days that were as long<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">As twenty days are now.<br /></span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>But the golden window at which Geoffrey sat
was in Monmouth, and he was called Geoffrey
of Monmouth. That was some seven hundred
years ago. No doubt the little town was very
busy even in 1137 when Geoffrey sat at his
window and wrote his famous chronicle called
<i>British History</i>.</p>

<p>Before Geoffrey began to write down his marvelous
stories, other stories and poems were written.
In King Alfred's time, when the home of
English literature was shifted from the north to
the south, two fine battle songs were written.
They were the "Song of Brunanburh" and the
"Song of the Fight at Maldon." These were
written in the tenth century. "The Charge of
the Light Brigade," composed some eight hundred
years later by the poet Tennyson, is like these old
songs in its short, rapid lines and in its thought.
Every one should learn these lines from the poem
Alfred Tennyson wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>


<div class="poem">

    <span class="i0">Into the valley of Death<br /></span>
    <span class="i2">Rode the six hundred.<br /></span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>But we have been long enough away from that
golden window by which Geoffrey of Monmouth
sat and wrote his immortal stories. Geoffrey
was called a chronicler. And what he was supposed
to be doing was jotting down accurately
historical events year after year. Some of the
chronicles written in this way have become the
chief sources of English history. Among the
men who wrote these chronicles were William of
Malmesbury and Matthew Paris. And between
them came Geoffrey himself.</p>

<p>It will never be known, unless it should prove
possible to roll time back some seven hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>years, just what Geoffrey did see from his window
as he looked out upon the busy town of
Monmouth, or all that went on in his nimble
mind. In any event it is plain that he had the
best of good times inventing or retelling stories
in his chronicle. There is to be found the story
of King Lear and his three daughters, Regan,
Goneril, and Cordelia&mdash;Lear, the hero of Shakespeare's
play, "King Lear," written over four hundred
years later. There, too, is the story of Ferrex
and Porrex. Geoffrey had a nimble quill pen
with which to follow his nimble wit. He writes
of Julius Cæsar and of how he came to Great
Britain. What Geoffrey of Monmouth says may
be ridiculous enough in the light of history, but
there it is, and there is Cæsar himself, not only
looking upon the coast of Britain but actually
standing upon it. We become familiar, too, with
many names known in stories about King Arthur.
Perceval is one of these. And Uther Pendragon,
who was the father of King Arthur, is another.</p>

<p>One of the marvelous facts about Geoffrey is
that when he looked out of that golden window
he could see so much farther than just Monmouth.
He could see all the way to the sea, and on its
shores that beautiful city Tintagel, where Queen
Igraine, the mother of Arthur, lived. But in
Geoffrey's chronicle she was called Igerna. A
name is sometimes like a long, long journey, not
only in its romance, but also because it takes you
to other lands and other people, and passes, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
as the road upon a long journey, through many
changes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Geoffrey saw from his golden window not only
Tintagel, that beautiful South Welsh city by the
sea, but also a little village in North Wales called
Beddgelert. This little village is set down in the
midst of mountains like a lump of sugar in the
bottom of a deep cup. Outside this little village
is a hill called Dinas Emrys. Geoffrey looked
northward out of his golden window in Monmouth,
and what do you think he saw? He saw the
magician, Merlin, the youth who had never had
a father. And this lad was quarreling with another
lad in Caernarvon, a Welsh city thirteen
miles away from the little village of Beddgelert.</p>

<p>Now Vortigern had been attempting to build a
tower on Dinas Emrys, but whatever the workmen
did one day was swallowed up the next.</p>

<p>Then some wise men said to Vortigern: "You
must find a youth who has never had a father.
You must sacrifice him and sprinkle the foundations
with his blood."</p>

<p>So Vortigern sent men to find a boy who had
never had a father and who should be brought
him that they might kill him. When Vortigern's
messenger reached Caernarvon, thirteen miles
away from Beddgelert and the hill Dinas Emrys,
they found two boys playing games and quarreling
about their parentage. And one of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Dabutius, was accusing the other, Merlin, of having
no father. They took him to Vortigern.</p>

<p>And Vortigern said, "My magicians told me to
seek out a lad who had no father, with whose
blood the foundations of my building are to be
sprinkled to make it stand."</p>

<p>"Order your magicians," answered Merlin, "to
come before me and I will convict them of a lie."</p>

<p>It is a terrible thing to be convicted of a lie,
and of course the magicians did not wish to
come. But King Vortigern made them come and
ordered them to sit down before Merlin.</p>

<p>Merlin spoke to them after this manner: "Because
you are ignorant what it is that hinders the
foundations of the tower, you have told the King
to kill me and to cement the stones with my
blood. But tell me now, what is there under the
foundations that will not suffer it to stand?"</p>

<p>To this they gave no answer, for they were
frightened.</p>

<p>Then said Merlin, "I entreat your Majesty
would command your workmen to dig into the
ground, and you will find a pond which causes
the foundations to sink."</p>

<p>This the King had done, and a pond was found
there.</p>

<p>Then said Merlin to the King's magicians,
"Tell me, ye false men, what is there under the
pond?"</p>

<p>But they were afraid to answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Merlin turned to King Vortigern and said,
"Command the pond to be drained, and at the
bottom you will see two hollow stones, and in
them are two dragons asleep."</p>

<p>The King had the pond drained, and he found
all just as Merlin said it would be. And as the
King sat on the edge of the drained pond out came
the two dragons, one red and one white, and, approaching
each other, they began to fight, blowing
forth fire from their nostrils. At last the white
dragon got the advantage and made the red
dragon fly to the other end of the drained pond.</p>

<p>When King Vortigern asked Merlin to explain
what this meant, Merlin burst into tears.</p>

<p>Then commanding his voice, he spoke: "In
the days that are to come gold shall be squeezed
from the lily and the nettle, and silver shall flow
from the hoofs of bellowing cattle. The teeth
of wolves shall be blunted and the lion's whelps
shall be transformed into sea-fishes."</p>

<p>And unto this day nobody knows exactly what
Merlin meant, or what Geoffrey thought he
meant, although there has been much guessing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Geoffrey must have been very fond of looking
out of his window and seeing Merlin, for many
a story he tells about him. There is the story of
how Merlin helped to remove the stones of the
Giants' Dance from Ireland. Giants of old had
brought them from the farthest coast of Africa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
They were mystical stones and had value to heal
and cure men. When these stones were found too
heavy to be lifted by human hands, Merlin found
a way, nevertheless, to lift them. Then the stones
of the Giants' Dance were carried across the sea
and placed in England at Stonehenge. It is an
exciting story Geoffrey tells about the Giants'
Dance, yet I fear we know no more really how the
big stones got to Stonehenge than we know about
the ribs of our solid earth. Certainly those stones
were set up in Stonehenge even before men began
recording history or Geoffrey of Monmouth sat
in his golden window.</p>

<p>And there is the story of the 40,060 kings who
never existed&mdash;which is more almost than ever
did exist. And of the coming of St. Augustine to
England, bringing with him the gentle religion of
Christ.</p>

<p>It would be very nice if all this about Merlin
and the dragons and the Giants' Dance were
what might be called true history. Alas, it is not!
In the first place, Geoffrey tells stories which vary
greatly from what was actually known to be
history. Then, too, this chronicle is full, as you
have seen, of miraculous stories of one sort or
another. And there are other reasons, also, why
these delightful stories of Geoffrey of Monmouth
must be taken with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>But it is because Geoffrey did sit at his window
in the little town of Monmouth, writing these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
stories which have to be taken with a pinch of salt,
that English story-telling began to grow. Geoffrey's
imagination was to English story-telling
what the sunlight is in making a tulip grow.
Story-telling grew out of the Chronicles, the so-called
historical literature. The men of Geoffrey's
time said that "he had lied saucily and
shamelessly." No doubt he had. Yet these
same men could not help reading the stories
he told, for they were so interesting that all men
read them. What he had done was to take several
Welsh legends, put them together cleverly,
as a carpenter joins a delicate bit of woodwork,
translate these Welsh legends into Latin and call
the work a Chronicle. Not only was it read in
England, but it was read all over the continent
of Europe, too. It had great success.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Gaimer put these stories into French.
The stories traveled to France. Once there, other
legends were added, and when Geoffrey's Chronicle
turned up again in England it came back as the
work of Wace, a Norman trouveur, or ballad-singer.
But Geoffrey's stories were too good to let drop even
after they had been through so many hands. An
English priest in Worcestershire by the name of
Layamon, translating the French poem which
Wace had made out of Geoffrey's prose stories,
retold the stories in English poetry. That was in
1205, after Geoffrey had died.</p>

<p>Geoffrey of Monmouth must have been very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
happy as he sat in his sunny, golden window and
heard about the tales he had written there. He
must have chuckled many a time over what the
world had made out of his nimble story-telling
wits. English literature could not be at all the
same, in either prose or poetry, if it were not for
that golden palace door over which was written
<i>Welsh</i> or that window upon the stairway where
Geoffrey sat.</p>

<p>But it was the Normans who brought the taste
for history with them to England in 1066, when
they conquered the land which had been King
Alfred's land. It was some time before the Normans
became what we call English in their feeling.
Probably the Normans would never have become
so strongly English in feeling if English patriotism,
even after the conquest of 1066, had not remained
very much alive. The English had written
down in English some of the proverbs of their
former King Alfred. The parents of the chronicler,
William of Malmesbury, were both English
and Norman. And, strangely enough, Layamon's
"Brut" is not unlike the poetry of the cowherd
Cædmon, the first of the great English singers,
the first of English poets.</p>

<p>Perhaps this very hour the sun is shining down
upon that golden window of Geoffrey of Monmouth,
and laughing for joy because the man who
"lied so saucily" was the first of the great English
story-tellers.</p>

<small>A FAMOUS KITCHEN BOY</small></h2>


<p>Geoffrey's window is a very fascinating
place to be&mdash;possibly the most interesting
window the world has ever seen. It is not just
one lifetime which has found that window interesting,
but more lifetimes than we can count
comfortably. Sir Thomas Malory, who wrote his
<i>Morte d'Arthur</i> in 1469, fairly lived in that window;
so did Shakespeare when he wrote "King
Lear" in 1605, and even the modern poet, Alfred,
Lord Tennyson, who wrote "The Charge of the
Light Brigade," composed a series of poems called
"Idylls of the King," which return for their sources
through Malory to Geoffrey at his window.</p>

<p>There is one story, however, which Geoffrey did
not see as he looked out of his golden window&mdash;the
story of the famous kitchen boy, or "Gareth
and Linet." This tale is found in Sir Thomas
Malory's <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, which was not completed
until 1469, many years after the writing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>of Geoffrey's Chronicle in 1147. Clear and sunshiny
is the English of this wonderful book of
Malory's, and nowhere in the world can more
beautiful, exciting, and marvelous stories be found
than between the covers of the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>.
The <i>Morte d'Arthur</i> was written about twenty
years after the invention of printing by Coster
and Gutenberg. Sixteen years after the completion
of the book by Malory, Caxton printed it
in black letter in English. There is only one perfect
copy of this book by Caxton, the first of the
English printers, and that is in Brooklyn, New
York. In the preface which Caxton wrote for
the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, he says that in this book
will be found "many joyous and pleasant histories,
and noble and renowned acts of humanity, gentleness
and chivalries.... Do after the good and
leave the evil, and it shall bring you good fame
and renown." Certainly that is what the kitchen
boy did, and it brought him to good fame.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was one day when King Arthur was holding
a Round Table court at Kynke Kenadonne by the
sea. And they were at their meat, three hundred
and fifty knights, when there came into the hall
two men well clad and fine-looking. And, as the
old story says, there leaned upon their shoulders
"the goodliest young man and the fairest that
ever they all saw, and he was large and long and
broad in the shoulders, and well visaged, and the
fairest and the largest-handed that ever man saw,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a><br /></span>but he fared as if he might not go or bear himself&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>


<p>The two men supported the young man up to
the high dais upon which Arthur was feasting.
When the young man that was being helped forward
was seen there was silence. Then the young
man stretched up straight and besought Arthur
that he would give him three gifts.</p>

<p>"The first gift I will ask now," he said, "but
the other two gifts I will ask this day twelve
months wheresoever you hold your high feast."</p>

<p>"Ask," replied Arthur, "and you shall have
your asking."</p>

<p>"Sir, this is my petition for this feast: that you
will give me meat and drink enough for this twelvemonth,
and at that day I will ask mine other two
gifts."</p>

<p>"My fair son," said Arthur, "ask better. This
is but simple asking."</p>

<p>But the young man would ask no more. And
when the King, who had taken a great liking to
him, asked him for his name, the young man said
that he could not tell him.</p>

<p>The King took him to Sir Kay, the steward,
and charged him to give the young man the best
of all the meats and drinks and to treat him as
a lord's son.</p>

<p>But Sir Kay was angry, and said: "An he had
come of gentlemen, he would have asked of you
horse and armor, but such as he is, so he asketh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
And since he hath no name, I shall give him a
name that shall be Beaumains, that is Fair-hands,
and into the kitchen shall I bring him, and there
he shall have fat brose every day, that he shall
be as fat by the twelvemonth's end as a pork
hog."</p>

<p>And Sir Kay scorned him and mocked at him.
On hearing this both Sir Launcelot, the greatest
of the Knights of the Round Table, and Sir
Gawaine were wroth and bade Sir Kay leave his
mocking.</p>

<p>"I dare lay my head," said Sir Launcelot, "he
shall prove a man of great worship."</p>

<p>"It may not be by no reason," replied Sir Kay,
"for as he is so hath he asked."</p>

<p>Beaumains, or Fair-hands, was put into the
kitchen, and lay there nightly as the boys of the
kitchen did. The old book says: "He endured
all that twelvemonth, and never displeased man
nor child, but always he was meek and mild. But
ever when he saw any jousting of knights, that
would he see an he might."</p>

<p>Sir Launcelot gave him gold to spend, and
clothes, and whenever the boy went where there
were games or feats of strength he excelled in
them all.</p>

<p>But always Sir Kay would taunt him with these
words spoken to others, "How like you my boy
of the kitchen?"</p>

<p>And so Fair-hands, the kitchen boy, continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
in service for a year. At the close of the year
came a lady to the court and told about her sister
who was besieged in a castle by a tyrant who was
called the Red Knight of the Red Laundes. But
she would not tell her name, and therefore the
King would not permit any of his knights to
go with her to rescue her sister from the Red
Knight, who was one of the worst knights in the
world.</p>

<p>But at the King's refusal, Beaumains, or Fair-hands,
as he was called, spoke, "Sir King, God
thank you, I have been this twelvemonth in your
kitchen, and have had my full sustenance, and
now I will ask my two gifts that be behind."</p>

<p>"Ask, upon my peril," said the King.</p>

<p>"Sir, this shall be my two gifts: first, that you
will permit me to go with this maiden that I may
rescue her sister. And second, that Sir Launcelot
shall ride after me and make me knight when I
require it of him."</p>

<p>And both these requests the King granted.
But the maiden was angry because, she said, he
had given her naught but his kitchen page.</p>

<p>Then came one to Fair-hands and told him that
his horse and armor were come for him. And
there was a dwarf with everything that Beaumains
needed, and all of it the richest and best it
was possible for man to have. But though he was
horsed and trapped in cloth of gold, he had neither
shield nor spear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Then said Sir Kay openly before all, "I will ride
after my boy of the kitchen."</p>

<p>Just as Beaumains overtook the maiden, so did
Sir Kay overtake his former kitchen page.</p>

<p>"Sir, know you not me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yea," said Beaumains, "I know you for an
ungentle knight of the court. Therefore beware
of me."</p>

<p>Thereupon Sir Kay put his spear in the rest and
ran straight upon him, and Beaumains came fast
upon him with his sword in his hand. And Beaumains
knocked the spear out of the knight's hand
and Sir Kay fell down as he had been dead.
Beaumains took Sir Kay's shield and spear and
rode away upon his own horse. The dwarf took
Sir Kay's horse.</p>

<p>Just then along came Sir Launcelot, and Beaumains
challenged him to a joust. And so they
fought for the better part of an hour, rushing together
like infuriated boars. And Sir Launcelot
marveled at the young man's strength, for he
fought more like a giant than like a knight. At
last he said, "Fight not so sore; your quarrel and
mine is not so great but we may leave off."</p>

<p>"Truly that is truth," said Beaumains, "but
it doth me good to feel your strength, and yet,
my lord, I showed not the most I could do."</p>

<p>Then Sir Launcelot confessed to Beaumains
that he had much ado to save himself, and that
Beaumains need fear no earthly knight. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
then Beaumains confessed to Sir Launcelot that
he was the brother of Sir Gawaine and the youngest
son of King Lot; that his mother, Dame Morgawse,
was sister to King Arthur, and that his
name was Gareth.</p>

<p>After that Launcelot knighted Gareth, and
Gareth rode on after the maiden whose sister was
kept a prisoner by the Red Knight.</p>

<p>When he overtook her she turned upon him
and said: "Get away from me, for thou smellest
all of the kitchen. Thy clothes are dirty with
grease and tallow. What art thou but a ladle-washer?"</p>

<p>"Damosel," replied Beaumains, "say to me
what you will, I will not go from you whatsoever
you say, for I have undertaken to King Arthur for
to achieve your adventure, and so shall I finish
it to the end or I shall die therefor."</p>

<p>Then came a man thereby calling for help, for
six thieves were after him. Even when Beaumains
had slain all the six thieves and set the man
free from his fears, then the maiden used him
despicably, calling him kitchen boy and other
shameful names.</p>

<p>On the next day Beaumains slew two knights
who would not allow him and the maiden to cross
a great river.</p>

<p>But all the maiden did was to taunt him.
"Alas," she said, "that ever a kitchen page should
have that fortune to destroy even two doughty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
knights; but it was not rightly force, for the first
knight stumbled and he was drowned in the water,
and by mishap thou earnest up behind the last
knight and thus happily slew him."</p>

<p>"Say what you will," said Beaumains, "but with
whomsoever I have ado withall, I trust to God
to serve him or he depart."</p>

<p>"Fie, fie, foul kitchen knave," answered the
maiden, "thou shalt see knights that shall abate
thy boast."</p>

<p>And so she continued to scold him and would
not rest therefrom. And they came to a black
land, and there was a black hawthorn, and
thereon hung a black banner, and on the other
side there hung a black shield, and by it stood a
black spear great and long, and a great black
horse covered with silk, and a black stone fast by.</p>

<p>And before the Knight of the Black Lands the
maiden used Beaumains despicably, calling him
kitchen knave and other such names. And the
Black Knight and Beaumains came together for
battle as if it had been thunder. After hard
struggle Beaumains killed the Black Knight and
rode on after the damosel.</p>

<p>"Away, kitchen boy, out of the wind," she
cried, "for the smell of thy clothes grieves me."</p>

<p>And so ever despitefully she used him. Yet he
overcame the Green Knight, who was the brother
of the Black Knight, and spared his life at the
maiden's request.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>And it was after the vanquishing of the Green
Knight that they saw a tower as white as any
snow, and all around the castle it was double-diked.
Over the tower gate there hung fifty
shields of divers colors, and under that tower was
a fair meadow. And the lord of the tower looked
out of his window and beheld Beaumains, the
maiden, and the dwarf coming.</p>

<p>"With that knight will I joust," called the lord
of the tower, "for I see that he is a knight
errant."</p>

<p>And before the knight the maiden used him
despitefully.</p>

<p>And ever he replied, patiently, "Damosel, you
are uncourteous so to rebuke me, for meseemeth I
have done you good service." Then did the heart
of the maiden soften a little.</p>

<p>"I marvel what manner of man you be," she said,
"for it may never be otherwise but that you come
of a noble blood, for so shamefully did woman
never rule a knight as I have done you, and ever
courteously you have suffered me, and that comes
never but of gentle blood."</p>

<p>"Damosel," answered Beaumains, "a knight
may little do that may not suffer a damosel.
And whether I be gentleman born or not, I let
you wit, fair damosel, I have done you gentleman's
service."</p>

<p>She begged him to forgive her, and this Beaumains
did with all his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they met Sir Persant of Inde, who was
dwelling only seven miles from the siege, and the
maiden besought Beaumains to flee while there
was yet time. But he refused.</p>

<p>And when Sir Persant and Beaumains met
they met with all that ever their horses might run,
and broke their spears either into three pieces,
and their horses rushed so together that both
their horses fell dead to the earth. And they got
off their horses and fought for more than two
hours. And Beaumains spared his life only at
the maiden's request.</p>

<p>Then Beaumains told Sir Persant that his name
was Sir Gareth. And the maiden said that hers
was Linet, and that she was sister to Dame
Lionesse, who was besieged.</p>

<p>Then the dwarf took word to the lady who
was besieged, and the others came on after.</p>

<p>"How escaped he," said the lady, Dame Lionesse,
"from the brethren of Sir Persant?"</p>

<p>"Madam," said the dwarf, "as a noble knight
should."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Dame Lionesse, "commend me unto
your gentle knight, and pray him to eat and drink
and make him strong. Also pray him that he be
of good heart and courage, for he shall meet with
a knight who is neither of bounty, courtesy, nor
gentleness; for he attendeth unto nothing but
murder, and that is the cause I cannot praise him
nor love him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>All that night Beaumains lay in an hermitage,
and upon the morn he and the damosel Linet broke
their fast and heard mass. Then took they their
horses, and, riding through a fair forest, they
came out upon a plain where there were many
pavilions and tents and a castle and much smoke
and a great noise. When they came near the
siege Beaumains espied upon great trees goodly
knights hanging by the neck, their shields about
their necks with their swords, and gilt spurs upon
their heels. There hung high forty knights.</p>

<p>"What meanest this?" said Sir Beaumains.</p>

<p>"Fair sir, "answered the damosel, "these knights
came hither to this siege to rescue my sister,
Dame Lionesse, and when the Red Knight of the
Red Lands had overcome them he put them to
this shameful death."</p>

<p>Then rode they to the dikes, and saw them
double-diked with full warlike walls; and there
were lodged many great lords nigh the walls;
and there was great noise of minstrelsy; and the
sea beat upon the side of the walls, where there
were many ships and mariners' noise. And also
there was fast by a sycamore-tree, and there hung
a horn, the greatest that ever they saw, of an
elephant's bone. Therewith Beaumains spurred
his horse straight to the sycamore-tree, and blew
so eagerly the horn that all the siege and the castle
rang thereof. And then there leaped out knights
out of their tents and pavilions, and they within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the castle looked over the walls and out of windows.
Then the Red Knight of the Red Lands armed
him hastily, and two barons set on his spurs upon
his heels, and all was blood red, his armor, spear,
and shield.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the damosel Linet, "look you be glad
and light, for yonder is your deadly enemy, and
at yonder window is my sister, Dame Lionesse."</p>

<p>Then Beaumains and the Red Knight put their
spears in their rests, and came together with all
their might, and either smote the other in the
middle of their shields, that the surcingles and
cruppers broke and fell to the earth both, and the
two knights lay stunned upon the ground. But
soon they got to their feet and drew their swords
and ran together like two fierce lions. And then
they fought until it was past noon, tracing, racing,
and foining as two boars. Thus they endured
until evensong time, and their armor was
so hewn to pieces that men might see their naked
sides. Then the Red Knight gave Beaumains
a buffet upon the helm, so that he fell groveling
to the earth.</p>

<p>Then cried the maiden Linet on high: "Oh, Sir
Beaumains, where is thy courage? Alas! my sister
beholdeth thee and she sobbeth and weepeth."</p>

<p>When Beaumains heard this he lifted himself
up with great effort and got upon his feet, and
lightly he leaped to his sword and gripped it in
his hand. And he smote so thick that he smote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the sword out of the Red Knight's hand. Sir
Beaumains fell upon him and unlaced his helm
to have slain him. But at the request of the
lords he saved his life and made him yield him
to the lady.</p>

<p>And so it was that Beaumains, or Sir Gareth,
as his real name was, came into the presence of
his lady and won her love through his meekness
and gentleness and courtesy and courage, as every
true knight should win the love of his lady.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So ends happily one of the charming stories of
adventure and knighthood in one of the greatest
Cycles of Romance the world has ever known.
Indeed, in that Great Palace we have entered,
and some of whose golden doors we have been
opening, there is no door more loved by human
beings than the one over which is written <i>Romance</i>,
for boys and girls and their elders have
always loved a romantic story, and always will.</p>

<p>There are four great romantic stories in the
Palace of English Literature. The first is <i>King
Arthur and the Round Table</i>, which Geoffrey of
Monmouth discovered for us by his golden window.
The second great romance is the story of
Charlemagne. This was in the twelfth century,
and the most valiant story which grew out of the
Charlemagne Cycle was that of Roland. Every
one should know the story of Roland and his
famous sword, Durendal. The third is the <i>Life</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span><i>of Alexander</i>, which came to England from the
east. And the fourth is the <i>Siege of Troy</i>, composed
in the thirteenth century and written in
Latin.</p>

<p>It takes many, many stories to satisfy our love
of Romance. As we pass through the golden door
over which is written <i>Romance</i>, one whole wall is
filled with the names of lesser romances forgotten
long, long ago. But the stories which Sir Thomas
Malory gave us in his <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, written in
1469, will never be forgotten as long as the English
language is spoken.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
